All Rights Reserved.Introduction: The use of technological resources to support processes in health systems has generated robust, interoperable and dynamic platforms. In the case of institutions working with neglected tropical diseases (NTD), there is a need for NTD-specific customizations. Objectives: To establish a medical records platform, specialized for NTD, which would facilitate the analysis of treatment evolution in patients, as well as generate more accurate data about various clinical aspects. Materials and methods: Here we developed a customized electronic medical record system based on OpenMRS for multiple NTDs. A set of forms and functionalities was developed under the OpenMRS guidelines, using shared community modules. Results: All the customized information was packaged in a distribution called NTD Health. The platform is web-based and can be upgraded and improved by users without technological barriers. Conclusions: The EMR system can become a useful tool for other institutions to improve their health practices as well as the quality of life for NTD patients, simplifying the customization of healthcare systems able to interoperate with other platforms.",
