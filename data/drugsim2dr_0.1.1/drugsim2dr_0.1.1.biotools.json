    "description": "A systematic biology tool was developed to repurpose drugs via a drug-drug functional similarity network. 'DrugSim2DR' first predict drug-drug functional similarity in the context of specific disease, and then using the similarity constructed a weighted drug similarity network. Finally, it used a network propagation algorithm on the network to identify drugs with significant target abnormalities as candidate drugs.",
