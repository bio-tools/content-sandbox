                "abstract": "The Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD), available online at https://epd.epfl.ch, provides accurate transcription start site (TSS) information for promoters of 15 model organisms plus corresponding functional genomics data that can be viewed in a genome browser, queried or analyzed via web interfaces, or exported in standard formats (FASTA, BED, CSV) for subsequent analysis with other tools. Recent work has focused on the improvement of the EPD promoter viewers, which use the UCSC Genome Browser as visualization platform. Thousands of high-resolution tracks for CAGE, ChIP-seq and similar data have been generated and organized into public track hubs. Customized, reproducible promoter views, combining EPD-supplied tracks with native UCSC Genome Browser tracks, can be accessed from the organism summary pages or from individual promoter entries. Moreover, thanks to recent improvements and stabilization of ncRNA gene catalogs, we were able to release promoter collections for certain classes of ncRNAs from human and mouse. Furthermore, we developed automatic computational protocols to assign orphan TSS peaks to downstream genes based on paired-end (RAMPAGE) TSS mapping data, which enabled us to add nearly 9000 new entries to the human promoter collection. Since our last article in this journal, EPD was extended to five more model organisms: rhesus monkey, rat, dog, chicken and Plasmodium falciparum.",

Thanks to the abundant release of new high-throughput transcript mapping data (CAGE, TSS-seq, GRO-cap) the database could be extended to plant and fungal species. We further report on the expansion of the mass genome annotation (MGA) repository containing promoter-relevant chromatin profiling data and on improvements for the EPD entry viewers. Finally, we present a new data access tool, ChIP-Extract, which enables computational biologists to extract diverse types of promoter-associated data in numerical table formats that are readily imported into statistical analysis platforms such as R.",
