                "abstract": "Motivation: Protein sequence comparison is a fundamental element in the bioinformatics toolkit. When sequences are annotated with features such as functional domains, transmembrane domains, low complexity regions or secondary structure elements, the resulting feature architectures allow better informed comparisons. However, many existing schemes for scoring architecture similarities cannot cope with features arising from multiple annotation sources. Those that do fall short in the resolution of overlapping and redundant feature annotations. Results: Here, we introduce FAS, a scoring method that integrates features from multiple annotation sources in a directed acyclic architecture graph. Redundancies are resolved as part of the architecture comparison by finding the paths through the graphs that maximize the pair-wise architecture similarity. In a large-scale evaluation on more than 10 000 human-yeast ortholog pairs, architecture similarities assessed with FAS are consistently more plausible than those obtained using e-values to resolve overlaps or leaving overlaps unresolved. Three case studies demonstrate the utility of FAS on architecture comparison tasks: benchmarking of orthology assignment software, identification of functionally diverged orthologs, and diagnosing protein architecture changes stemming from faulty gene predictions. With the help of FAS, feature architecture comparisons can now be routinely integrated into these and many other applications. Availability and implementation: FAS is available as python package: https://pypi.org/project/greedyFAS/.",
