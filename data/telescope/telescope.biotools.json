    "description": "Telescope is an open-source web application that tracks the progress of jobs submitted to remote servers using Sun Grid Engine (SGE) on-demand scheduling system. It allows remote scheduling of pre-defined pipelines, as well as re-scheduling queued jobs. Moreover, output files are rendered in HTML in real time, allowing the use of markdown and rich-text features. Telescope does not assume anything from the remote server, except for SSH connection. The connection is established using SSH key pairs that are stored after encrypted.",
