                "abstract": "The discovery of Differentially Methylated (DM) regions is an important research field in biology, as it can help to anticipate the risk of suffering from specific diseases. Nevertheless, the high computational cost of the bioinformatic tools developed for this purpose prevents their application to large-scale datasets. Hence, much faster tools are required to further progress in this research field. In this work we present ParRADMeth, a parallel tool that applies beta-binomial regression for the identification of these DM regions. It is based on the state-of-the-art sequential tool RADMeth, which proved superior biological accuracy compared to counterparts in previous experimental evaluations. ParRADMeth provides the same DM regions as RADMeth but at significantly reduced runtime thanks to exploiting the compute capabilities of common multicore CPU clusters. For example, our tool is up to 189 times faster for real data experiments on a cluster with 16 nodes, each one containing two eight-core processors. The source code of ParRADMeth, as well as a reference manual, are available at https://github.com/UDC-GAC/ParRADMeth.",
