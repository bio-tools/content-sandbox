                "abstract": "Recently, cyclic peptides have been considered breakthrough drugs because they can interact with “undruggable” targets such as intracellular protein-protein interactions. Membrane permeability is an essential indicator of oral bioavailability and intracellular targeting, and the development of membrane-permeable peptides is a bottleneck in cyclic peptide drug discovery. Although many experimental data on membrane permeability of cyclic peptides have been reported, a comprehensive database is not yet available. A comprehensive membrane permeability database is essential for developing computational methods for cyclic peptide drug design. In this study, we constructed CycPeptMPDB, the first web-accessible database of cyclic peptide membrane permeability. We collected information on a total of 7334 cyclic peptides, including the structure and experimentally measured membrane permeability, from 45 published papers and 2 patents from pharmaceutical companies. To unambiguously represent cyclic peptides larger than small molecules, we used the hierarchical editing language for macromolecules notation to generate a uniform sequence representation of peptides. In addition to data storage, CycPeptMPDB provides several supporting functions such as online data visualization, data analysis, and downloading. CycPeptMPDB is expected to be a valuable platform to support membrane permeability research on cyclic peptides. CycPeptMPDB can be freely accessed at http://cycpeptmpdb.com.",
