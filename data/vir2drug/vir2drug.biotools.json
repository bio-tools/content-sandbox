                "abstract": "Â© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press.We draw from the assumption that similarities between pathogens at both pathogen protein and host protein level, may provide the appropriate framework to identify and rank candidate drugs to be used against a specific pathogen. Vir2Drug is a drug repurposing tool that uses network-based approaches to identify and rank candidate drugs for a specific pathogen, combining information obtained from: (a) ranked pathogen-to-pathogen networks based on protein similarities between pathogens, (b) taxonomy distance between pathogens and (c) drugs targeting specific pathogen's and host proteins. The underlying pathogen networks are used to screen drugs by means of specific methodologies that account for either the host or pathogen's protein targets. Vir2Drug is a useful and yet informative tool for drug repurposing against known or unknown pathogens especially in periods where the emergence for repurposed drugs plays significant role in handling viral outbreaks, until reaching a vaccine. The web tool is available at: https://bioinformatics.cing.ac.cy/vir2drug, https://vir2drug.cing-big.hpcf.cyi.ac.cy.",
