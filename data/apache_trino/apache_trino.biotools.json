    "description": "Trino is a distributed SQL query engine designed to query large data sets distributed over one or more heterogeneous data sources.\n\nTrino is a tool designed to efficiently query vast amounts of data using distributed queries. If you work with terabytes or petabytes of data, you are likely using tools that interact with Hadoop and HDFS. Trino was designed as an alternative to tools that query HDFS using pipelines of MapReduce jobs, such as Hive or Pig, but Trino is not limited to accessing HDFS. Trino can be and has been extended to operate over different kinds of data sources, including traditional relational databases and other data sources such as Cassandra.\n\nTrino was designed to handle data warehousing and analytics: data analysis, aggregating large amounts of data and producing reports. These workloads are often classified as Online Analytical Processing (OLAP).",
