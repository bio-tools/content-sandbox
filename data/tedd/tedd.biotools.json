Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Characterization of the specific expression and chromatin profiles of genes enables understanding how they contribute to tissue/organ development and the mechanisms leading to diseases. Whilst the number of single-cell sequencing studies is increasing dramatically; however, data mining and reanalysis remains challenging. Herein, we systematically curated the up-to-date and most comprehensive datasets of sequencing data originating from 2760 bulk samples and over 5.1 million single-cells from multiple developmental periods from humans and multiple model organisms. With unified and systematic analysis, we profiled the gene expression and chromatin accessibility among 481 cell-types, 79 tissue-types and 92 timepoints, and pinpointed cells with the co-expression of target genes. We also enabled the detection of gene(s) with a temporal and cell-type specific expression profile that is similar to or distinct from that of a target gene. Additionally, we illustrated the potential upstream and downstream gene-gene regulation interactions, particularly under the same biological process(es) or KEGG pathway(s). Thus, TEDD (Temporal Expression during Development Database), a value-added database with a user-friendly interface, not only enables researchers to identify cell-type/tissue-type specific and temporal gene expression and chromatin profiles but also facilitates the association of genes with undefined biological functions in development and diseases.
