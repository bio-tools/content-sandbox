                "abstract": "Â© 2022 American Chemical Society.Elucidating and accurately predicting the druggability and bioactivities of molecules plays a pivotal role in drug design and discovery and remains an open challenge. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have made remarkable advancements in graph-based molecular property prediction. However, current graph-based deep learning methods neglect the hierarchical information of molecules and the relationships between feature channels. In this study, we propose a well-designed hierarchical informative graph neural network (termed HiGNN) framework for predicting molecular property by utilizing a corepresentation learning of molecular graphs and chemically synthesizable breaking of retrosynthetically interesting chemical substructure (BRICS) fragments. Furthermore, a plug-and-play feature-wise attention block is first designed in HiGNN architecture to adaptively recalibrate atomic features after the message passing phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiGNN achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance on many challenging drug discovery-associated benchmark data sets. In addition, we devise a molecule-fragment similarity mechanism to comprehensively investigate the interpretability of the HiGNN model at the subgraph level, indicating that HiGNN as a powerful deep learning tool can help chemists and pharmacists identify the key components of molecules for designing better molecules with desired properties or functions.
