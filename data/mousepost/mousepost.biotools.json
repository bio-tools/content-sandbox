Because recently these genome sequences have been significantly updated and sequences of 16 extra strains added by the Mouse Genomes Project, a profound update, correction and expansion of the Mousepost 1.0 database has been performed and is reported here. Moreover, we have added a new class of protein disturbing sequence polymorphisms (besides stop codon losses, stop codon gains, small insertions and deletions, and missense mutations), namely start codon mutations. The current version, Mousepost 2.0 (https://mousepost.be), therefore is a significantly updated and invaluable tool available to the community and is described here and foreseen by multiple examples.",
