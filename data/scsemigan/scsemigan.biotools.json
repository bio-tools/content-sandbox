As more and more well-annotated scRNA-seq reference data are publicly available, automatical label transference algorithms are gaining popularity over manual marker gene-based annotation methods. However, most existing methods fail to unify cell-type annotation with dimensionality reduction and are unable to generate deep latent representation from the perspective of data generation. RESULTS: In this article, we propose scSemiGAN, a single-cell semi-supervised cell-type annotation and dimensionality reduction framework based on a generative adversarial network, to overcome these challenges, modeling scRNA-seq data from the aspect of data generation. Our proposed scSemiGAN is capable of performing deep latent representation learning and cell-type label prediction simultaneously. Through extensive comparison with four state-of-the-art annotation methods on diverse simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets, scSemiGAN achieves competitive or superior performance in multiple downstream tasks including cell-type annotation, latent representation visualization, confounding factor removal and enrichment analysis. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code and data of scSemiGAN are available on GitHub: https://github.com/rafa-nadal/scSemiGAN. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
