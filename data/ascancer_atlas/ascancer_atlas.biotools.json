                "abstract": "Â© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Alternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental process that governs almost all aspects of cellular functions, and dysregulation in this process has been implicated in tumor initiation, progression and treatment resistance. With accumulating studies of carcinogenic mis-splicing in cancers, there is an urgent demand to integrate cancer-associated splicing changes to better understand their internal cross-talks and functional consequences from a global view. However, a resource of key functional AS events in human cancers is still lacking. To fill the gap, we developed ASCancer Atlas (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ascancer), a comprehensive knowledgebase of aberrant splicing in human cancers. Compared to extant databases, ASCancer Atlas features a high-confidence collection of 2006 cancer-associated splicing events experimentally proved to promote tumorigenesis, a systematic splicing regulatory network, and a suit of multi-scale online analysis tools. For each event, we manually curated the functional axis including upstream splicing regulators, splicing event annotations, downstream oncogenic effects, and possible therapeutic strategies. ASCancer Atlas also houses about 2 million computationally putative splicing events. Additionally, a user-friendly web interface was built to enable users to easily browse, search, visualize, analyze, and download all splicing events. Overall, ASCancer Atlas provides a unique resource to study the functional roles of splicing dysregulation in human cancers.",
