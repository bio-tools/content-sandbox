                "abstract": "Prediction of the interactions between small molecules and their targets play important roles in various applications of drug development, such as lead discovery, drug repurposing and elucidation of potential drug side effects. Therefore, a variety of machine learning-based models have been developed to predict these interactions. In this study, a model called auxiliary multi-task graph isomorphism network with uncertainty weighting (AMGU) was developed to predict the inhibitory activities of small molecules against 204 different kinases based on the multi-task Graph Isomorphism Network (MT-GIN) with the auxiliary learning and uncertainty weighting strategy. The calculation results illustrate that the AMGU model outperformed the descriptor-based models and state-of-the-art graph neural networks (GNN) models on the internal test set. Furthermore, it also exhibited much better performance on two external test sets, suggesting that the AMGU model has enhanced generalizability due to its great transfer learning capacity. Then, a naïve model-agnostic interpretable method for GNN called edges masking was devised to explain the underlying predictive mechanisms, and the consistency of the interpretability results for 5 typical epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors with their structure‒activity relationships could be observed. Finally, a free online web server called KIP was developed to predict the kinome-wide polypharmacology effects of small molecules (http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/kip).",
