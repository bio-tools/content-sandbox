To help fully exploit such data and facilitate their interpretation, metabolomic data obtained from different facilities and different samples should be integrated and compared. However, large-scale integration of such data for biological discovery is challenging given that they are obtained from various types of sample at different facilities and by different measurement techniques, and the target metabolites and sensitivities to detect them also differ from study to study. Results: We developed iDMET, a network-based approach to integrate metabolomic data from different studies based on the differential metabolomic profiles between two groups, instead of the metabolite profiles themselves. As an application, we collected cancer metabolomic data from 27 previously published studies and integrated them using iDMET. A pair of metabolomic changes observed in the same disease from two studies were successfully connected in the network, and a new association between two drugs that may have similar effects on the metabolic reactions was discovered. Conclusions: We believe that iDMET is an efficient tool for integrating heterogeneous metabolomic data and discovering novel relationships between biological phenomena.",
