                "abstract": "© 2022, The Author(s).Synesthesia is a phenomenon where sensory stimuli or cognitive concepts elicit additional perceptual experiences. For instance, in a commonly studied type of synesthesia, stimuli such as words written in black font elicit experiences of other colors, e.g., red. In order to objectively verify synesthesia, participants are asked to choose colors for repeatedly presented stimuli and the consistency of their choices is evaluated (consistency test). Previously, there has been no publicly available and easy-to-use tool for analyzing consistency test results. Here, the R package synr is introduced, which provides an efficient interface for exploring consistency test data and applying common procedures for analyzing them. Importantly, synr also implements a novel method enabling identification of participants whose scores cannot be interpreted, e.g., who only give black or red color responses. To this end, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is applied in conjunction with a measure of spread in 3D space. An application of synr with pre-existing openly accessible data illustrating how synr is used in practice is presented. Also included is a comparison of synr’s data validation procedure and human ratings, which found that synr had high correspondence with human ratings and outperformed human raters in situations where human raters were easily mislead. Challenges for widespread adoption of synr as well as suggestions for using synr within the field of synesthesia and other areas of psychological research are discussed.",
