                "abstract": "Copyright Â© 2022 Sengupta, Saha, Halder, Chatterjee, Nasipuri, Basu and Plewczynski.Protein function prediction is gradually emerging as an essential field in biological and computational studies. Though the latter has clinched a significant footprint, it has been observed that the application of computational information gathered from multiple sources has more significant influence than the one derived from a single source. Considering this fact, a methodology, PFP-GO, is proposed where heterogeneous sources like Protein Sequence, Protein Domain, and Protein-Protein Interaction Network have been processed separately for ranking each individual functional GO term. Based on this ranking, GO terms are propagated to the target proteins. While Protein sequence enriches the sequence-based information, Protein Domain and Protein-Protein Interaction Networks embed structural/functional and topological based information, respectively, during the phase of GO ranking. Performance analysis of PFP-GO is also based on Precision, Recall, and F-Score. The same was found to perform reasonably better when compared to the other existing state-of-art. PFP-GO has achieved an overall Precision, Recall, and F-Score of 0.67, 0.58, and 0.62, respectively. Furthermore, we check some of the top-ranked GO terms predicted by PFP-GO through multilayer network propagation that affect the 3D structure of the genome.
