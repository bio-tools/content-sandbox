                "abstract": "IEEEThe lesion recognition of dermoscopy images is significant for automated skin cancer diagnosis. Most of the existing methods ignore the medical perspective, which is crucial since this task requires a large amount of medical knowledge. A few methods are designed according to medical knowledge, but they ignore to be fully in line with doctors&#x2019; entire learning and diagnosis process, since certain strategies and steps of those are conducted in practice for doctors. Thus, we put forward Clinical-Inspired Network (CI-Net) to involve the learning strategy and diagnosis process of doctors, as for a better analysis. The diagnostic process contains three main steps: the zoom step, the observe step and the compare step. To simulate these, we introduce three corresponding modules: a lesion area attention module, a feature extraction module and a lesion feature attention module. To simulate the distinguish strategy, which is commonly used by doctors, we introduce a distinguish module. We evaluate our proposed CI-Net on six challenging datasets, including ISIC 2016, ISIC 2017, ISIC 2018, ISIC 2019, ISIC 2020 and PH2 datasets, and the results indicate that CI-Net outperforms existing work.
