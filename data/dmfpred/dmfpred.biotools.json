This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDP/IDRs) are widespread in living organisms and perform various essential molecular functions. These functions are summarized as six general categories, including entropic chain, assembler, scavenger, effector, display site, and chaperone. The alteration of IDP functions is responsible for many human diseases. Therefore, identifying the function of disordered proteins is helpful for the studies of drug target discovery and rational drug design. Experimental identification of the molecular functions of IDP in the wet lab is an expensive and laborious procedure that is not applicable on a large scale. Some computational methods have been proposed and mainly focus on predicting the entropic chain function of IDRs, while the computational predictive methods for the remaining five important categories of disordered molecular functions are desired. Motivated by the growing numbers of experimental annotated functional sequences and the need to expand the coverage of disordered protein function predictors, we proposed DMFpred for disordered molecular functions prediction, covering disordered assembler, scavenger, effector, display site and chaperone. DMFpred employs the Protein Cubic Language Model (PCLM), which incorporates three protein language models for characterizing sequences, structural and functional features of proteins, and attention-based alignment for understanding the relationship among three captured features and generating a joint representation of proteins. The PCLM was pre-trained with large-scaled IDR sequences and finetuned with functional annotation sequences for molecular function prediction. The predictive performance evaluation on five categories of functional and multi-functional residues suggested that DMFpred provides high-quality predictions.
