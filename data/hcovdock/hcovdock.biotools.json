For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.Covalent inhibitors have received extensive attentions in the past few decades because of their long residence time, high binding efficiency and strong selectivity. Therefore, it is valuable to develop computational tools like molecular docking for modeling of covalent protein-ligand interactions or screening of potential covalent drugs. Meeting the needs, we have proposed HCovDock, an efficient docking algorithm for covalent protein-ligand interactions by integrating a ligand sampling method of incremental construction and a scoring function with covalent bond-based energy. Tested on a benchmark containing 207 diverse protein-ligand complexes, HCovDock exhibits a significantly better performance than seven other state-of-the-art covalent docking programs (AutoDock, Cov_DOX, CovDock, FITTED, GOLD, ICM-Pro and MOE). With the criterion of ligand root-mean-squared distance < 2.0 Å, HCovDock obtains a high success rate of 70.5% and 93.2% in reproducing experimentally observed structures for top 1 and top 10 predictions. In addition, HCovDock is also validated in virtual screening against 10 receptors of three proteins. HCovDock is computationally efficient and the average running time for docking a ligand is only 5 min with as fast as 1 sec for ligands with one rotatable bond and about 18 min for ligands with 23 rotational bonds. HCovDock can be freely assessed at http://huanglab.phys.hust.edu.cn/hcovdock/.",
