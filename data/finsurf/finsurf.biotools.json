    "description": "FINSURF (Functional Identification of Non-coding Sequences Using Random Forests) is a tool designed to analyse lists of sequences variants in the human genome.\nIt assigns a score to each variant, reflecting its functional importance and therefore its likelihood to disrupt the physiology of its carrier. FINSURF scores Single Nucleotide Variants (SNV), insertions and deletions. Among SNVs, transitions and transversions are treated separately. Insertions are characterised by a score given to each base flanking the insertion point. Deletions are characterised by a score at every deleted base. FINSURF can (optionally) use a list of known or suspected disease genes, in order to restrict results to variants overlapping cis-regulatory elements linked to these genes.\n\nFor a variant of interest, users can generate a graphical representation of \"feature contributions », showing the relative contributions of genomic, functional or evolutionary information to its score.",

                "abstract": "Whole genome sequencing is increasingly used to diagnose medical conditions of genetic origin. While both coding and non-coding DNA variants contribute to a wide range of diseases, most patients who receive a WGS-based diagnosis today harbour a protein-coding mutation. Functional interpretation and prioritization of non-coding variants represents a persistent challenge, and disease-causing non-coding variants remain largely unidentified. Depending on the disease, WGS fails to identify a candidate variant in 20–80% of patients, severely limiting the usefulness of sequencing for personalised medicine. Here we present FINSURF, a machine-learning approach to predict the functional impact of non-coding variants in regulatory regions. FINSURF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, owing in particular to optimized control variants selection during training. In addition to ranking candidate variants, FINSURF breaks down the score for each variant into contributions from individual annotations, facilitating the evaluation of their functional relevance. We applied FINSURF to a diverse set of 30 diseases with described causative non-coding mutations, and correctly identified the disease-causative non-coding variant within the ten top hits in 22 cases. FINSURF is implemented as an online server to as well as custom browser tracks, and provides a quick and efficient solution to prioritize candidate non-coding variants in realistic clinical settings.",
