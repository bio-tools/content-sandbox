                "abstract": "Â© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Single sample pathway analysis (ssPA) transforms molecular level omics data to the pathway level, enabling the discovery of patient-specific pathway signatures. Compared to conventional pathway analysis, ssPA overcomes the limitations by enabling multi-group comparisons, alongside facilitating numerous downstream analyses such as pathway-based machine learning. While in transcriptomics ssPA is a widely used technique, there is little literature evaluating its suitability for metabolomics. Here we provide a benchmark of established ssPA methods (ssGSEA, GSVA, SVD (PLAGE), and z-score) alongside the evaluation of two novel methods we propose: ssClustPA and kPCA, using semi-synthetic metabolomics data. We then demonstrate how ssPA can facilitate pathway-based interpretation of metabolomics data by performing a case-study on inflammatory bowel disease mass spectrometry data, using clustering to determine subtype-specific pathway signatures. Results: While GSEA-based and z-score methods outperformed the others in terms of recall, clustering/dimensionality reduction-based methods provided higher precision at moderate-to-high effect sizes. A case study applying ssPA to inflammatory bowel disease data demonstrates how these methods yield a much richer depth of interpretation than conventional approaches, for example by clustering pathway scores to visualise a pathway-based patient subtype-specific correlation network. We also developed the sspa python package (freely available at https://pypi.org/project/sspa/), providing implementations of all the methods benchmarked in this study. Conclusion: This work underscores the value ssPA methods can add to metabolomic studies and provides a useful reference for those wishing to apply ssPA methods to metabolomics data.",
