                "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality, where the fertilized embryo grows outside of the uterus. Recent experiments on mice have uncovered the importance of genetic factors in the transport of embryos inside the uterus. In the past, efforts have been made to identify possible gene or protein markers in EP in humans through multiple expression studies. Although there exist comprehensive gene resources for other maternal health disorders, there is no specific resource that compiles the genes associated with EP from such expression studies. Here, we address that knowledge gap by creating a computational resource, Ectopic Pregnancy Expression Knowledgebase (EPEK), that involves manual compilation and curation of expression profiles of EP in humans from published articles. In EPEK, we compiled information on 314 differentially expressed genes, 17 metabolites, and 3 SNPs associated with EP. Computational analyses on the gene set from EPEK showed the implication of cellular signaling processes in EP. We also identified possible exosome markers that could be clinically relevant in the diagnosis of EP. In a nutshell, EPEK is the first and only dedicated resource on the expression profile of EP in humans. EPEK is accessible at https://cb.imsc.res.in/epek.",
