                "abstract": "Â© 2022 The AuthorsSingle-cell transcriptomics offers opportunities to investigate ligand-receptor (LR) interactions between heterogeneous cell populations within tissues. However, most existing tools for the inference of intercellular communication do not allow prioritization of functional LR associations that provoke certain biological responses in the receiver cells. In addition, current tools do not enable the identification of the impact on the downstream cell types of the receiver cells. We present CommPath, an open-source R package and webserver, to analyze and visualize the LR interactions and pathway-mediated intercellular communication chain with single-cell transcriptomic data. CommPath curates a comprehensive signaling pathway database to interpret the consequences of LR associations and therefore infers functional LR interactions. Furthermore, CommPath determines cell-cell communication chain by considering both the upstream and downstream cells of user-defined cell populations. Applying CommPath to human hepatocellular carcinoma dataset shows its ability to decipher complex LR interaction patterns and the associated intercellular communication chain, as well as their changes in disease versus homeostasis.",
