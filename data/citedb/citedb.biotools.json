Published by Oxford University Press.MOTIVATION: The interactions among various types of cells play critical roles in cell functions and the maintenance of the entire organism. While cell-cell interactions are traditionally revealed from experimental studies, recent developments in single-cell technologies combined with data mining methods have enabled computational prediction of cell-cell interactions, which have broadened our understanding of how cells work together, and have important implications in therapeutic interventions targeting cell-cell interactions for cancers and other diseases. Despite the importance, to our knowledge, there is no database for systematic documentation of high-quality cell-cell interactions at the cell type level, which hinders the development of computational approaches to identify cell-cell interactions. RESULTS: We develop a publicly accessible database, CITEdb (Cell-cell InTEraction database, https://citedb.cn/), which not only facilitates interactive exploration of cell-cell interactions in specific physiological contexts (e.g. a disease or an organ) but also provides a benchmark dataset to interpret and evaluate computationally derived cell-cell interactions from different tools. CITEdb contains 728 pairs of cell-cell interactions in human that are manually curated. Each interaction is equipped with structured annotations including the physiological context, the ligand-receptor pairs that mediate the interaction, etc. Our database provides a web interface to search, visualize and download cell-cell interactions. Users can search for cell-cell interactions by selecting the physiological context of interest or specific cell types involved. CITEdb is the first attempt to catalogue cell-cell interactions at the cell type level, which is beneficial to both experimental, computational and clinical studies of cell-cell interactions. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CITEdb is freely available at https://citedb.cn/ and the R package implementing benchmark is available at https://github.com/shanny01/benchmark. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
