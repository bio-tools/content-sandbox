    "description": "BeeDeeM is a general-purpose Bioinformatics Databank Manager. \n\nIt is capable of installing sequence databanks, such as: Genbank, Refseq, Embl, Genpept, Swissprot, TrEmbl, Fasta and Silva, as well as any files using these formats. In addition, BeeDeeM can install major biological classifications (ontologies), such as NCBI Taxonomy, Gene Ontology, Enzyme and Intepro. \n\nBeeDeeM can be used from the command-line or from a graphical user interface. It is cluster ready: use of a job scheduler (e.g. PBS, SLURM), smooth use of cluster structures (e.g. data downloading from Internet-connected nodes vs. data processing on network-isolated nodes).\n\nFinally, the software comes with utility tools such as databank filtering and querying, and BLAST/DIAMOND/PLAST annotator tools; banks installed by BeeDeeM being indexed, they can be used to collect features data (including ontologies) and add all that information within results of above mentioned sequence comparison tools.",
