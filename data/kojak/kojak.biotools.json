                "abstract": "Fragmentation ion spectral analysis of chemically cross-linked proteins is an established technology in the proteomics research repertoire for determining protein interactions, spatial orientation, and structure. Here we present Kojak version 2.0, a major update to the original Kojak algorithm, which was developed to identify cross-linked peptides from fragment ion spectra using a database search approach. A substantially improved algorithm with updated scoring metrics, support for cleavable cross-linkers, and identification of cross-links between 15N-labeled homomultimers are among the newest features of Kojak 2.0 presented here. Kojak 2.0 is now integrated into the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline, enabling access to dozens of additional tools within that suite. In particular, the PeptideProphet and iProphet tools for validation of cross-links improve the sensitivity and accuracy of correct cross-link identifications at user-defined thresholds. These new features improve the versatility of the algorithm, enabling its use in a wider range of experimental designs and analysis pipelines. Kojak 2.0 remains open-source and multiplatform.",

                "abstract": "Protein chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry enable the analysis of protein-protein interactions and protein topologies; however, complicated cross-linked peptide spectra require specialized algorithms to identify interacting sites. The Kojak cross-linking software application is a new, efficient approach to identify cross-linked peptides, enabling large-scale analysis of protein-protein interactions by chemical cross-linking techniques. The algorithm integrates spectral processing and scoring schemes adopted from traditional database search algorithms and can identify cross-linked peptides using many different chemical cross-linkers with or without heavy isotope labels. Kojak was used to analyze both novel and existing data sets and was compared to existing cross-linking algorithms. The algorithm provided increased cross-link identifications over existing algorithms and, equally importantly, the results in a fraction of computational time. The Kojak algorithm is open-source, cross-platform, and freely available. This software provides both existing and new cross-linking researchers alike an effective way to derive additional cross-link identifications from new or existing data sets. For new users, it provides a simple analytical resource resulting in more cross-link identifications than other methods.",
