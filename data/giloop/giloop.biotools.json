                "abstract": "Â© 2022Graph and image are two common representations of Hi-C cis-contact maps. Existing computational tools have only adopted Hi-C data modeled as unitary data structures but neglected the potential advantages of synergizing the information of different views. Here we propose GILoop, a dual-branch neural network that learns from both representations to identify genome-wide CTCF-mediated loops. With GILoop, we explore the combined strength of integrating the two view representations of Hi-C data and corroborate the complementary relationship between the views. In particular, the model outperforms the state-of-the-art loop calling framework and is also more robust against low-quality Hi-C libraries. We also uncover distinct preferences for matrix density by graph-based and image-based models, revealing interesting insights into Hi-C data elucidation. Finally, along with multiple transfer-learning case studies, we demonstrate that GILoop can accurately model the organizational and functional patterns of CTCF-mediated looping across different cell lines.",
