                "abstract": "Â© 2022 Elsevier LtdComparative analysis among multiple gene lists on their functional features is now a routine task due to the advancement of high-throughput experiments. Several enrichment analysis tools were developed in the past. However, these tools mainly focus on one gene list and contain only gene ontology or interaction features. What makes it worse, comparative investigation and customized feature set reanalysis are still unavailable. Therefore, we constructed the YMLA (Yeast Multiple List Analyzer) platform in this research. YMLA includes 39 yeast features and facilitates comparative analysis among multiple gene lists via tabular views, heatmaps, and network plots. Moreover, the customized feature set reanalysis function was implemented in YMLA to help form mechanism hypotheses based on a selected enriched feature subset. We demonstrated the biological applicability of YMLA via example lists consisting of genes with top/bottom translation efficiency values. The analysis results provided by YMLA reveal novel facts consistent with previous experiments. YMLA is available at https://cosbi7.ee.ncku.edu.tw/YMLA/.",
