                "abstract": "IEEEIdentifying protein targets for drugs establishes an indispensable knowledge foundation for drug repurposing and drug development. Though expensive and time-consuming, vitro trials are widely employed to discover drug targets, and the existing relevant computational algorithms still cannot satisfy the demand for real application in drug R&amp;D with regards to the prediction accuracy and performance efficiency, which are urgently needed to be improved. To this end, we propose here the PPAEDTI model, which uses the graph personalized propagation technique to predict drug-target interactions from the known interaction network. To evaluate the prediction performance, six benchmark datasets were used for testing with some state-of-the-art methods compared. As a result, using the 5-fold cross-validation, the proposed PPAEDTI model achieves average AUCs&gt;90&#x0025; on 5 collected datasets. We also manually checked the top-20 prediction list for 2 proteins (hsa:775 and hsa:779) and a kind of drug (D00618), and successfully confirmed 18, 17, and 20 items from the public datasets, respectively. The experimental results indicate that, given known drug-target interactions, the PPAEDTI model can provide accurate predictions for the new ones, which is anticipated to serve as a useful tool for pharmacology research. Using the proposed model that was trained with the collected datasets, we have built a computational platform that is accessible at <uri>http://120.77.11.78/PPAEDTI/</uri> and corresponding codes and datasets are also released.",
