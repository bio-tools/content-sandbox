                "abstract": "© 2022 The Author(s)Comet assay provides an easy solution to estimate DNA damage in single cells through microscopy assessment. It is widely used in the analysis of genotoxic damages induced by radiotherapy or chemotherapeutic agents. DNA damage is quantified at the single-cell level by computing the displacement between the genetic material within the nucleus, typically called “comet head”, and the genetic material in the surrounding part of the cell, considered as the “comet tail”. Today, the number of works based on Comet Assay analyses is really impressive. In this work, besides revising the solutions available to obtain reproducible and reliable quantitative data, we developed an easy-to-use tool named CometAnalyser. It is designed for the analysis of both fluorescent and silver-stained wide-field microscopy images and allows to automatically segment and classify the comets, besides extracting Tail Moment and several other intensity/morphological features for performing statistical analysis. CometAnalyser is an open-source deep-learning tool. It works with Windows, Macintosh, and UNIX-based systems.
