                "abstract": "© 2022 The Author(s)Existing methods for integrating functional annotations in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to fine-map and prioritize potential causal variants are limited to using non-overlapped categorical annotations or limited by the computation burden of modeling genome-wide variants. To overcome these limitations, we propose a scalable Bayesian functional GWAS method to account for multivariate quantitative functional annotations (BFGWAS_QUANT), accompanied by a scalable computation algorithm enabling joint modeling of genome-wide variants. Simulation studies validated the performance of BFGWAS_QUANT for accurately quantifying annotation enrichment and improving GWAS power. Applying BFGWAS_QUANT to study five Alzheimer disease (AD)-related phenotypes using individual-level GWAS data (n = ∼1,000), we found that histone modification annotations have higher enrichment than expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) annotations for all considered phenotypes, with the highest enrichment in H3K27me3 (polycomb regression). We also found that cis-eQTLs in microglia had higher enrichment than eQTLs of bulk brain frontal cortex tissue for all considered phenotypes. A similar enrichment pattern was also identified using the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) summary-level GWAS data of AD (n = ∼54,000). The strongest known APOE E4 risk allele was identified for all five phenotypes, and the APOE locus was validated using the IGAP data. BFGWAS_QUANT fine-mapped 32 significant variants from 1,073 genome-wide significant variants in the IGAP data. We also demonstrated that the polygenic risk scores (PRSs) using effect size estimates by BFGWAS_QUANT had a similar prediction accuracy as other methods assuming a sparse causal model. Overall, BFGWAS_QUANT is a useful GWAS tool for quantifying annotation enrichment and prioritizing potential causal variants.",
