For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.Updated and expert-quality knowledge bases are fundamental to biomedical research. A knowledge base established with human participation and subject to multiple inspections is needed to support clinical decision making, especially in the growing field of precision oncology. The number of original publications in this field has risen dramatically with the advances in technology and the evolution of in-depth research. Consequently, the issue of how to gather and mine these articles accurately and efficiently now requires close consideration. In this study, we present OncoPubMiner (https://oncopubminer.chosenmedinfo.com), a free and powerful system that combines text mining, data structure customisation, publication search with online reading and project-centred and team-based data collection to form a one-stop 'keyword in-knowledge out' oncology publication mining platform. The platform was constructed by integrating all open-access abstracts from PubMed and full-text articles from PubMed Central, and it is updated daily. OncoPubMiner makes obtaining precision oncology knowledge from scientific articles straightforward and will assist researchers in efficiently developing structured knowledge base systems and bring us closer to achieving precision oncology goals.",
