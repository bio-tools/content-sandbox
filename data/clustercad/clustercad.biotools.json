                "abstract": "Â© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Megasynthase enzymes such as type I modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) play a central role in microbial chemical warfare because they can evolve rapidly by shuffling parts (catalytic domains) to produce novel chemicals. If we can understand the design rules to reshuffle these parts, PKSs and NRPSs will provide a systematic and modular way to synthesize millions of molecules including pharmaceuticals, biomaterials, and biofuels. However, PKS and NRPS engineering remains difficult due to a limited understanding of the determinants of PKS and NRPS fold and function. We developed ClusterCAD to streamline and simplify the process of designing and testing engineered PKS variants. Here, we present the highly improved ClusterCAD 2.0 release, available at https://clustercad.jbei.org. ClusterCAD 2.0 boasts support for PKS-NRPS hybrid and NRPS clusters in addition to PKS clusters; a vastly enlarged database of curated PKS, PKS-NRPS hybrid, and NRPS clusters; a diverse set of chemical 'starters' and loading modules; the new Domain Architecture Cluster Search Tool; and an offline Jupyter Notebook workspace, among other improvements. Together these features massively expand the chemical space that can be accessed by enzymes engineered with ClusterCAD.",
