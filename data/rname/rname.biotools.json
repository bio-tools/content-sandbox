                "abstract": "© 2022 The Author(s)The dynamic RNA modifications were orchestrated by a series of enzymes, namely “writer”, “reader” and “eraser”, which can install, recognize and remove the modifications, respectively. However, only a very small number of experimentally validated RNA modification enzymes have been identified and reported. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a database to deposit RNA modification enzymes. In the present work, we developed the RNAME database (https://chenweilab.cn/rname/) to provide a comprehensive resource for RNA modification enzymes. The current version of RNAME deposits more than 21,000 manually curated RNA modification enzymes, which are from 456 species and covers the 7 common kinds of RNA modifications (i.e., adenosine to inosine, N1-methyladenosine, N6-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytidine, N7-methylguanosine, mRNA cap modification, and pseudouridine). The 3D structures, domains, subcellular locations, and biological functions of these enzymes were also integrated in RNAME. It is anticipated that RNAME will facilitate the researches on RNA modifications.",
