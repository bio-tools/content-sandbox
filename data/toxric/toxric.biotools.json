Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The toxic effects of compounds on environment, humans, and other organisms have been a major focus of many research areas, including drug discovery and ecological research. Identifying the potential toxicity in the early stage of compound/drug discovery is critical. The rapid development of computational methods for evaluating various toxicity categories has increased the need for comprehensive and system-level collection of toxicological data, associated attributes, and benchmarks. To contribute toward this goal, we proposed TOXRIC (https://toxric.bioinforai.tech/), a database with comprehensive toxicological data, standardized attribute data, practical benchmarks, informative visualization of molecular representations, and an intuitive function interface. The data stored in TOXRIC contains 113 372 compounds, 13 toxicity categories, 1474 toxicity endpoints covering in vivo/in vitro endpoints and 39 feature types, covering structural, target, transcriptome, metabolic data, and other descriptors. All the curated datasets of endpoints and features can be retrieved, downloaded and directly used as output or input to Machine Learning (ML)-based prediction models. In addition to serving as a data repository, TOXRIC also provides visualization of benchmarks and molecular representations for all endpoint datasets. Based on these results, researchers can better understand and select optimal feature types, molecular representations, and baseline algorithms for each endpoint prediction task. We believe that the rich information on compound toxicology, ML-ready datasets, benchmarks and molecular representation distribution can greatly facilitate toxicological investigations, interpretation of toxicological mechanisms, compound/drug discovery and the development of computational methods.",
