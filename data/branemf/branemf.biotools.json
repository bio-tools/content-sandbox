            "note": "The cellular system of a living organism is composed of interacting bio-molecules that control cellular processes at multiple levels. Their correspondences are represented by tightly regulated molecular networks. The increase of omics technologies has favored the generation of large-scale disparate data and the consequent demand for simultaneously using molecular and functional interaction networks: gene co-expression, proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI), genetic interaction and metabolic networks. They are rich sources of information at different molecular levels, and their effective integration is essential to understand cell functioning and their building blocks (proteins). \n\nWe test BraneMF with PPI networks of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a well-studied yeast model organism. We demonstrate the applicability of the learned features for essential multi-omics inference tasks: clustering, function and PPI prediction",
