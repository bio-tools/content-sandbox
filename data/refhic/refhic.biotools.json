                "abstract": "Â© 2022, The Author(s).Accurately annotating topological structures (e.g., loops and topologically associating domains) from Hi-C data is critical for understanding the role of 3D genome organization in gene regulation. This is a challenging task, especially at high resolution, in part due to the limited sequencing coverage of Hi-C data. Current approaches focus on the analysis of individual Hi-C data sets of interest, without taking advantage of the facts that (i) several hundred Hi-C contact maps are publicly available, and (ii) the vast majority of topological structures are conserved across multiple cell types. Here, we present RefHiC, an attention-based deep learning framework that uses a reference panel of Hi-C datasets to facilitate topological structure annotation from a given study sample. We compare RefHiC against tools that do not use reference samples and find that RefHiC outperforms other programs at both topological associating domain and loop annotation across different cell types, species, and sequencing depths.",
