                "abstract": "Background: Dihydrouridine (D) is one of the most significant uridine modifications that have a prominent occurrence in eukaryotes. The folding and conformational flexibility of transfer RNA (tRNA) can be attained through this modification. Objective: The modification also triggers lung cancer in humans. The identification of D sites was carried out through conventional laboratory methods; however, those were costly and time-consuming. The readiness of RNA sequences helps in the identification of D sites through computationally intelligent models. However, the most challenging part is turning these biological sequences into distinct vectors. Methods: The current research proposed novel feature extraction mechanisms and the identification of D sites in tRNA sequences using ensemble models. The ensemble models were then subjected to evaluation using k-fold cross-validation and independent testing. Results: The results revealed that the stacking ensemble model outperformed all the ensemble models by revealing 0.98 accuracy, 0.98 specificity, 0.97 sensitivity, and 0.92 Matthews Correlation Coefficient. The proposed model, iDHU-Ensem, was also compared with pre-existing predictors using an independent test. The accuracy scores have shown that the proposed model in this research study performed better than the available predictors. Conclusion: The current research contributed towards the enhancement of D site identification capabilities through computationally intelligent methods. A web-based server, iDHU-Ensem, was also made available for the researchers at https://taseersuleman-idhu-ensem-idhu-ensem.streamlit.app/.",
