Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Antibodies are ubiquitous key biological research resources yet are tricky to use as they are prone to performance issues and represent a major source of variability across studies. Understanding what antibody was used in a published study is therefore necessary to repeat and/or interpret a given study. However, antibody reagents are still frequently not cited with sufficient detail to determine which antibody was used in experiments. The Antibody Registry is a public, open database that enables citation of antibodies by providing a persistent record for any antibody-based reagent used in a publication. The registry is the authority for antibody Research Resource Identifiers, or RRIDs, which are requested or required by hundreds of journals seeking to improve the citation of these key resources. The registry is the most comprehensive listing of persistently identified antibody reagents used in the scientific literature. Data contributors span individual authors who use antibodies to antibody companies, which provide their entire catalogs including discontinued items. Unlike many commercial antibody listing sites which tend to remove reagents no longer sold, registry records persist, providing an interface between a fast-moving commercial marketplace and the static scientific literature.
