                "abstract": "© 2022 The Authors. Protein Science published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of The Protein Society.Protein sequence-based predictors of nucleic acid (NA)-binding include methods that predict NA-binding proteins and NA-binding residues. The residue-level tools produce more details but suffer high computational cost since they must predict every amino acid in the input sequence and rely on multiple sequence alignments. We propose an alternative approach that predicts content (fraction) of the NA-binding residues, offering more information than the protein-level prediction and much shorter runtime than the residue-level tools. Our first-of-its-kind content predictor, qNABpredict, relies on a small, rationally designed and fast-to-compute feature set that represents relevant characteristics extracted from the input sequence and a well-parametrized support vector regression model. We provide two versions of qNABpredict, a taxonomy-agnostic model that can be used for proteins of unknown taxonomic origin and more accurate taxonomy-aware models that are tailored to specific taxonomic kingdoms: archaea, bacteria, eukaryota, and viruses. Empirical tests on a low-similarity test dataset show that qNABpredict is 100 times faster and generates statistically more accurate content predictions when compared to the content extracted from results produced by the residue-level predictors. We also show that qNABpredict's content predictions can be used to improve results generated by the residue-level predictors. We release qNABpredict as a convenient webserver and source code at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/qNABpredict/. This new tool should be particularly useful to predict details of protein–NA interactions for large protein families and proteomes.",
