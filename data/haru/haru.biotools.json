    "description": "HARU is a heterogenous compute solution for Oxford Nanopore Technologies' adaptive sampling (also known as selective sequencing and Read Until). Read Until allows genomic reads to be analyzed in real-time and abandoned halfway, if not belonging to a genomic region of 'interest'. HARU takes advantage of heterogenous edge compute platforms and provides hardware acceleration using reconfigurable hardware on a Multiprocessor system on a chip (MPSoC).",
