                "abstract": "Molecular docking plays a major role in academic and industrial drug screening and discovery processes. Despite the availability of numerous docking software packages, there is a lot of scope for improvement for the docking algorithms in terms of becoming more reliable to replicate the experimental binding results. Here, we propose a combinatorial or consensus docking approach where complementary powers of the existing methods are captured. We created a meta-docking protocol by combining the results of AutoDock4.2, LeDock, and rDOCK programs as these are freely available, easy to use, and suitable for large-scale analysis and produced better performance on benchmarking studies. Rigorous benchmarking analyses were undertaken to evaluate the scoring, posing, and screening capability of our approach. Further, the performance measures were compared against one standard state-of-the-art commercial docking software, GOLD, and one freely available software, PLANTS. Performances of MetaDOCK for scoring, posing, and screening the protein-ligand complexes were found to be quite superior compared to the reference programs. Exhaustive molecular dynamics simulation and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann and surface area-based free energy estimation also suggest better energetic stability of the docking solutions produced by our meta-approach. We believe that the MetaDOCK approach is a useful packaging of the freely available software and provides a better alternative to the scientific community who are unable to afford costly commercial packages.",
