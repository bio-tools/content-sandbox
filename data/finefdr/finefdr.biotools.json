                "abstract": "Microbial community proteomics, also termed metaproteomics, investigates all proteins expressed by a microbiota. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the typical method for identifying proteins in metaproteomics, which involves searching the mass spectra against a protein sequence database. A major post-analysis step is controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), i.e., the ratio of false positives to the total number of annotations. The current popular target-decoy FDR estimation method treats all the peptides and proteins equally and overlooks that they could have varied probabilities of being identified. In this study, wer eport FineFDR, a framework for FDR assessment at fine-grained 1 evels with taxonomy information considered. FineFDR groups the identified peptide-spectrum matches, peptides, and proteins from different taxonomic units and estimates the FDR in each group separately. Empirical experiments on the simulated and real-world data sets demonstrate that our FineFDR achieved higher precision and more peptide and protein identifications when compared to the state-of-the-art methods, such as Comet, Percolator, TIDD, and Tailor.
