    "description": "CHOPCHOP is a versatile tool for selecting target sites for CRISPR (Cas9, Cas9 nickase, Cas13, Cpf1/CasX) or TALEN-directed mutagenesis. The latest release of CHOPCHOP (version 3) includes many new features and visualization options, supporting over 200 genomes with whole-gene targeting and versatile search modes. The tool now enables precise RNA targeting with Cas13, supporting alternative transcript isoforms and predicting RNA accessibility using ViennaRNA's RNAfold. The update also introduces new DNA targeting modes, including CRISPR activation/repression, targeted enrichment of loci for long-read sequencing, and prediction of Cas9 repair outcomes. For larger queries or handling unsupported genomes, a command-line version is available with additional functionalities. CHOPCHOP v3 is user-friendly and well-equipped to support diverse targeting applications, facilitating effective experimental design.",

                "abstract": "Major advances in genome editing have recently been made possible with the development of the TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 methods. The speed and ease of implementing these technologies has led to an explosion of mutant and transgenic organisms. A rate-limiting step in efficiently applying TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 methods is the selection and design of targeting constructs. We have developed an online tool, CHOPCHOP (https://chopchop.rc.fas.harvard.edu), to expedite the design process. CHOPCHOP accepts a wide range of inputs (gene identifiers, genomic regions or pasted sequences) and provides an array of advanced options for target selection. It uses efficient sequence alignment algorithms to minimize search times, and rigorously predicts off-target binding of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and TALENs. Each query produces an interactive visualization of the gene with candidate target sites displayed at their genomic positions and color-coded according to quality scores. In addition, for each possible target site, restriction sites and primer candidates are visualized, facilitating a streamlined pipeline of mutant generation and validation. The ease-of-use and speed of CHOPCHOP make it a valuable tool for genome engineering. © 2014 The Author(s).",

                "abstract": "In just 3 years CRISPR genome editing has transformed biology, and its popularity and potency continue to grow. New CRISPR effectors and rules for locating optimum targets continue to be reported, highlighting the need for computational CRISPR targeting tools to compile these rules and facilitate target selection and design. CHOPCHOP is one of the most widely used web tools for CRISPR- and TALEN-based genome editing. Its overarching principle is to provide an intuitive and powerful tool that can serve both novice and experienced users. In this major update we introduce tools for the next generation of CRISPR advances, including Cpf1 and Cas9 nickases. We support a number of new features that improve the targeting power, usability and efficiency of CHOPCHOP. To increase targeting range and specificity we provide support for custom length sgRNAs, and we evaluate the sequence composition of the whole sgRNA and its surrounding region using models compiled from multiple large-scale studies. These and other new features, coupled with an updated interface for increased usability and support for a continually growing list of organisms, maintain CHOPCHOP as one of the leading tools for CRISPR genome editing.

                "abstract": "The CRISPR-Cas system is a powerful genome editing tool that functions in a diverse array of organisms and cell types. The technology was initially developed to induce targeted mutations in DNA, but CRISPR-Cas has now been adapted to target nucleic acids for a range of purposes. CHOPCHOP is a web tool for identifying CRISPR-Cas single guide RNA (sgRNA) targets. In this major update of CHOPCHOP, we expand our toolbox beyond knockouts. We introduce functionality for targeting RNA with Cas13, which includes support for alternative transcript isoforms and RNA accessibility predictions. We incorporate new DNA targeting modes, including CRISPR activation/repression, targeted enrichment of loci for long-read sequencing, and prediction of Cas9 repair outcomes. Finally, we expand our results page visualization to reveal alternative isoforms and downstream ATG sites, which will aid users in avoiding the expression of truncated proteins. The CHOPCHOP web tool now supports over 200 genomes and we have released a command-line script for running larger jobs and handling unsupported genomes.

                "abstract": "The design of optimal guide RNA (gRNA) sequences for CRISPR systems is challenged by the need to achieve highly efficient editing at the desired location (on-target editing) with minimal editing at unintended locations (off-target editing). Although laboratory validation should ideally be used to detect off-target activity, computational predictions are almost always preferred in practice due to their speed and low cost. Several studies have therefore explored gRNA-DNA interactions in order to understand how CRISPR complexes select their genomic targets. CHOPCHOP (https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/) leverages these developments to build a user-friendly web interface that helps users design optimal gRNAs. CHOPCHOP supports a wide range of CRISPR applications, including gene knock-out, sequence knock-in, and RNA knock-down. Furthermore, CHOPCHOP offers visualization that enables an informed choice of gRNAs and supports experimental validation.
