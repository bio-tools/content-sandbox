However, the full-chain modelling appears to be lower on average accuracy than that for the constituent domains and requires higher demand on computing hardware, indicating the performance of full-chain modelling still needs to be improved. In this study, we investigate whether the predicted accuracy of the full-chain model can be further improved by domain assembly assisted by deep learning. RESULTS: In this article, we developed a structural analogue-based protein structure domain assembly method assisted by deep learning, named SADA. In SADA, a multi-domain protein structure database was constructed for the full-chain analogue detection using individual domain models. Starting from the initial model constructed from the analogue, the domain assembly simulation was performed to generate the full-chain model through a two-stage differential evolution algorithm guided by the energy function with an inter-residue distance potential predicted by deep learning. SADA was compared with the state-of-the-art domain assembly methods on 356 benchmark proteins, and the average TM-score of SADA models is 8.1% and 27.0% higher than that of DEMO and AIDA, respectively. We also assembled 293 human multi-domain proteins, where the average TM-score of the full-chain model after the assembly by SADA is 1.1% higher than that of the model by AlphaFold2. To conclude, we find that the domains often interact in the similar way in the quaternary orientations if the domains have similar tertiary structures. Furthermore, homologous templates and structural analogues are complementary for multi-domain protein full-chain modelling. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://zhanglab-bioinf.com/SADA.
