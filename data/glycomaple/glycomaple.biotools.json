                "abstract": "Glycans are one of the fundamental classes of macromolecules and are involved in a broad range of biological phenomena. A large variety of glycan structures can be synthesized depending on tissue or cell types and environmental changes. Here, we developed a comprehensive glycosylation mapping tool, termed GlycoMaple, to visualize and estimate glycan structures based on gene expression. We informatically selected 950 genes involved in glycosylation and its regulation. Expression profiles of these genes were mapped onto global glycan metabolic pathways to predict glycan structures, which were confirmed using glycomic analyses. Based on the predictions of N-glycan processing, we constructed 40 knockout HEK293 cell lines and analyzed the effects of gene knockout on glycan structures. Finally, the glycan structures of 64 cell lines, 37 tissues, and primary colon tumor tissues were estimated and compared using publicly available databases. Our systematic approach can accelerate glycan analyses and engineering in mammalian cells.",
