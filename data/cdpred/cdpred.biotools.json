Gluten immunogenic peptides have the potential to trigger immune responses which leads to damage the small intestine. HLA-DQ2/DQ8 are major alleles that bind to epitope/antigenic region of gluten and induce celiac disease. There is a need to identify CD associated epitopes in protein-based foods and therapeutics. Methods: In this study, computational tools have been developed to predict CD associated epitopes and motifs. Dataset used for training, testing and evaluation contain experimentally validated CD associated and non-CD associate peptides. We perform positional analysis to identify the most significant position of an amino acid residue in the peptide and checked the frequency of HLA alleles. We also compute amino acid composition to develop machine learning based models. We also developed ensemble method that combines motif-based approach and machine learning based models. Results and Discussion: Our analysis support existing hypothesis that proline (P) and glutamine (Q) are highly abundant in CD associated peptides. A model based on density of P&Q in peptides has been developed for predicting CD associated peptides which achieve maximum AUROC 0.98 on independent data. We discovered motifs (e.g., QPF, QPQ, PYP) which occurs specifically in CD associated peptides. We also developed machine learning based models using peptide composition and achieved maximum AUROC 0.99. Finally, we developed ensemble method that combines motif-based approach and machine learning based models. The ensemble model-predict CD associated motifs with 100% accuracy on an independent dataset, not used for training. Finally, the best models and motifs has been integrated in a web server and standalone software package “CDpred”. We hope this server anticipate the scientific community for the prediction, designing and scanning of CD associated peptides as well as CD associated motifs in a protein/peptide sequence (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/cdpred/).",
