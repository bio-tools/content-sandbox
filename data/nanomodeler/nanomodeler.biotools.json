                "abstract": "Functionalized metal nanoparticles (NPs) are macromolecular assemblies with a tunable physicochemical profile that makes them interesting for biotechnology, materials science, and energy conversion. In this regard, molecular simulations offer a way to scrutinize the structural and dynamical features of monolayer-protected NPs and their interactions with relevant matrices. Previously, we developed NanoModeler, a webserver that automates the preparation of functionalized gold NPs for atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Here, we present NanoModeler CG (www.nanomodeler.it), a new release of NanoModeler that now also allows the building and parametrizing of monolayer-protected metal NPs at a coarse-grained (CG) resolution. This new version extends our original methodology to NPs of eight different core shapes, conformed by up to 800,000 beads and coated by eight different monolayer morphologies. The resulting topologies are compatible with the Martini force field but are easily extendable to any other set of parameters parsed by the user. Finally, we demonstrate NanoModeler CGâ€™s capabilities by reproducing experimental structural features of alkylthiolated NPs and rationalizing the brush-to-mushroom phase transition of PEGylated anionic NPs. By automating the construction and parametrization of functionalized NPs, the NanoModeler series offers a standardized way to computationally model monolayer-protected nanosized systems.",
