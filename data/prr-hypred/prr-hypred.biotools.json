                "abstract": "Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize distinct features on the surface of pathogens or damaged cells and play key roles in the innate immune system. PRRs are divided into various families, including Toll-like receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors, nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptors, and C-type lectin receptors. As these are implicated in host health and several diseases, their accurate identification is indispensable for their functional characterization and targeted therapeutic approaches. Here, we construct PRR-HyPred, a novel two-layer hybrid framework in which the first layer predicts whether a given sequence is PRR or non-PRR using a support vector machine, and in the second, the predicted PRR sequence is assigned to a specific family using a random forest-based classifier. Based on a 10-fold cross-validation test, PRR-HyPred achieved 83.4 % accuracy in the first layer and 95 % in the second, with Matthew's correlation coefficient values of 0.639 and 0.816, respectively. This is the first study that can simultaneously predict and classify PRRs into specific families. PRR-HyPred is available as a web portal at https://procarb.org/PRRHyPred/. We hope that it could be a valuable tool for the large-scale prediction and classification of PRRs and subsequently facilitate future studies.",
