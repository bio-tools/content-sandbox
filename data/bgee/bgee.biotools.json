                "abstract": "Bgee is a database to retrieve and compare gene expression patterns in multiple animal species, produced by integrating multiple data types (RNA-Seq, Affymetrix, in situ hybridization, and EST data). It is based exclusively on curated healthy wild-type expression data (e.g., no gene knock-out, no treatment, no disease), to provide a comparable reference of normal gene expression. Curation includes very large datasets such as GTEx (re-annotation of samples as 'healthy' or not) as well as many small ones. Data are integrated and made comparable between species thanks to consistent data annotation and processing, and to calls of presence/absence of expression, along with expression scores. As a result, Bgee is capable of detecting the conditions of expression of any single gene, accommodating any data type and species. Bgee provides several tools for analyses, allowing, e.g., automated comparisons of gene expression patterns within and between species, retrieval of the prefered conditions of expression of any gene, or enrichment analyses of conditions with expression of sets of genes. Bgee release 14.1 includes 29 animal species, and is available at https://bgee.org/ and through its Bioconductor R package BgeeDB.",

                "abstract": "Gene expression patterns are a key feature in understanding gene function, notably in development. Comparing gene expression patterns between animals is a major step in the study of gene function as well as of animal evolution. It also provides a link between genes and phenotypes. Thus we have developed Bgee, a database designed to compare expression patterns between animals, by implementing ontologies describing anatomies and developmental stages of species, and then designing homology relationships between anatomies and comparison criteria between developmental stages. To define homology relationships between anatomical features we have developed the software Homolonto, which uses a modified ontology alignment approach to propose homology relationships between ontologies. Bgee then uses these aligned ontologies, onto which heterogeneous expression data types are mapped. These already include microarrays and ESTs.
