                "abstract": "© 2022, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Intron retention is the most common alternative splicing event in plants and plays a crucial role in the responses of plants to environmental signals. Despite a large number of RNA-seq libraries from different treatments and genetic mutants stored in public domains, a resource for querying the intron-splicing ratio of individual intron is still required. Here, we established the first-ever large-scale splicing efficiency database in any organism. Our database includes over 57,000 plant public RNA-seq libraries, comprising 25,283 from Arabidopsis, 17,789 from maize, 10,710 from rice, and 3,974 from soybean, and covers a total of 1.6 million introns in these four species. In addition, we manually curated and annotated all the mutant- and treatment-related libraries as well as their matched controls included in our library collection, and added graphics to display intron-splicing efficiency across various tissues, developmental stages, and stress-related conditions. The result is a large collection of 3,313 treatment conditions and 3,594 genetic mutants for discovering differentially regulated splicing efficiency. Our online database can be accessed at https://plantintron.com/.",
