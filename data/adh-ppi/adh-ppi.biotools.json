                "abstract": "© 2022 The AuthorsProtein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction is essential to understand the functions of proteins in various biological processes and their roles in the development, progression, and treatment of different diseases. To perform economical large-scale PPI analysis, several artificial intelligence-based approaches have been proposed. However, these approaches have limited predictive performance due to the use of in-effective statistical representation learning methods and predictors that lack the ability to extract comprehensive discriminative features. The paper in hand generates statistical representation of protein sequences by applying transfer learning in an unsupervised manner using FastText embedding generation approach. Furthermore, it presents “ADH-PPI” classifier which reaps the benefits of three different neural layers, long short-term memory, convolutional, and self-attention layers. Over two different species benchmark datasets, proposed ADH-PPI predictor outperforms existing approaches by an overall accuracy of 4%, and matthews correlation coefficient of 6%. In addition, it achieves an overall accuracy increment of 7% on four independent test sets. Availability: ADH-PPI web server is publicly available at https://sds_genetic_analysis.opendfki.de/PPI/",
