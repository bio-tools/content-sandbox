                "abstract": "Background and objective: Despite fast evolution cycles in deep learning methodologies for medical imaging in radiotherapy, auto-segmentation solutions rarely run in clinics due to the lack of open-source frameworks feasible for processing DICOM RT Structure Sets. Besides this shortage, available open-source DICOM RT Structure Set converters rely exclusively on 2D reconstruction approaches leading to pixelated contours with potentially low acceptance by healthcare professionals. PyRaDiSe, an open-source, deep learning framework independent Python package, addresses these issues by providing a framework for building auto-segmentation solutions feasible to operate directly on DICOM data. In addition, PyRaDiSe provides profound DICOM RT Structure Set conversion and processing capabilities; thus, it applies also to auto-segmentation-related tasks, such as dataset construction for deep learning model training. Methods: The PyRaDiSe package follows a holistic approach and provides DICOM data handling, deep learning model inference, pre-processing, and post-processing functionalities. The DICOM data handling allows for highly automated and flexible handling of DICOM image series, DICOM RT Structure Sets, and DICOM registrations, including 2D-based and 3D-based conversion from and to DICOM RT Structure Sets. For deep learning model inference, extending given skeleton classes is straightforwardly achieved, allowing for employing any deep learning framework. Furthermore, a profound set of pre-processing and post-processing routines is included that incorporate partial invertibility for restoring spatial properties, such as image origin or orientation. Results: The PyRaDiSe package, characterized by its flexibility and automated routines, allows for fast deployment and prototyping, reducing efforts for auto-segmentation pipeline implementation. Furthermore, while deep learning model inference is independent of the deep learning framework, it can easily be integrated into famous deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or Tensorflow. The developed package has successfully demonstrated its capabilities in a research project at our institution for organs-at-risk segmentation in brain tumor patients. Furthermore, PyRaDiSe has shown its conversion performance for dataset construction. Conclusions: The PyRaDiSe package closes the gap between data science and clinical radiotherapy by enabling deep learning segmentation models to be easily transferred into clinical research practice. PyRaDiSe is available on https://github.com/ubern-mia/pyradise and can be installed directly from the Python Package Index using pip install pyradise.",
