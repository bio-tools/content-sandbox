    "description": "Wgsim is a small tool for simulating sequence reads from a reference genome.\nIt is able to simulate diploid genomes with SNPs and insertion/deletion (INDEL)\npolymorphisms, and simulate reads with uniform substitution sequencing errors.\nIt does not generate INDEL sequencing errors, but this can be partly\ncompensated by simulating INDEL polymorphisms.\n\nWgsim outputs the simulated polymorphisms, and writes the true read coordinates\nas well as the number of polymorphisms and sequencing errors in read names.\nOne can evaluate the accuracy of a mapper or a SNP caller with wgsim_eval.pl\nthat comes with the package.",
