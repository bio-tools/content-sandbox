    "description": "VeryFastTree is a highly-tuned implementation of the FastTree-2 tool that takes advantage of parallelization and vectorization strategies to speed up the inference of phylogenies for huge alignments. It is important to highlight that VeryFastTree keeps unchanged the phases, methods and heuristics used by FastTree-2 to estimate the phylogenetic tree. In this way, it produces trees with the same topological accuracy than FastTree-2. In addition, unlike the parallel version of FastTree-2, VeryFastTree is deterministic.\n\nTo facilitate the adoption from the research community, VeryFastTree keeps exactly the same command line arguments than FastTree-2. In this way, it is only necessary to replace the call to FastTree-2 by a call to VeryFastTree using the same options to increase the overall performance.",

With speed at the core of its design, there are still important issues in the FastTree-2 implementation that harm its performance and scalability. To deal with these limitations, we introduce VeryFastTree, a highly tuned implementation of the FastTree-2 tool that takes advantage of parallelization and vectorization strategies to boost performance. Results: VeryFastTree is able to construct a tree on a standard server using double-precision arithmetic from an ultra-large 330k alignment in only 4.5 h, which is 7.8x and 3.5x faster than the sequential and best parallel FastTree-2 times, respectively. Availability and implementation: VeryFastTree is available at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/citiususc/ veryfasttree.",
