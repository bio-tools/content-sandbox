                "abstract": "Cancer is one of the leading causes of human death. As metabolomics techniques become more and more widely used in cancer research, metabolites are increasingly recognized as crucial factors in both cancer diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we developed MACdb (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/macdb), a curated knowledgebase to recruit themetabolic associations betweenmetabolites and cancers. Unlike conventional data-driven resources, MACdb integrates cancer- metabolic knowledge fromextensive publications, providing high quality metabolite associations and tools to supportmultiple research purposes. In the current implementation, MACdb has integrated 40,710 cancer-metabolite associations, covering 267 traits from 17 categories of cancers with high incidence or mortality, based entirely on manual curation from 1,127 studies reported in 462 publications (screened from 5,153 research papers). MACdb offers intuitive browsing functions to explore associations at multi-dimensions (metabolite, trait, study, and publication), and constructs knowledge graph to provide overall landscape among cancer, trait, and metabolite. Furthermore, NameToCid (map metabolite name to PubChem Cid) and Enrichment tools are developed to help users enrich the association of metabolites with various cancer types and traits. Implication: MACdb paves an informative and practical way to evaluate cancer-metabolite associations and has a great potential to help researchers identify key predictive metabolic markers in cancers.",
