                "abstract": "One of the major problems in bioimaging, often highly underestimated, is whether features extracted for a discrimination or regression task will remain valid for a broader set of similar experiments or in the presence of unpredictable perturbations during the image acquisition process. Such an issue is even more important when it is addressed in the context of deep learning features due to the lack of a priori known relationship between the black-box descriptors (deep features) and the phenotypic properties of the biological entities under study. In this regard, the widespread use of descriptors, such as those coming from pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), is hindered by the fact that they are devoid of apparent physical meaning and strongly subjected to unspecific biases, i.e., features that do not depend on the cell phenotypes, but rather on acquisition artifacts, such as brightness or texture changes, focus shifts, autofluorescence or photobleaching. The proposed Deep-Manager software platform offers the possibility to efficiently select those features having lower sensitivity to unspecific disturbances and, at the same time, a high discriminating power. Deep-Manager can be used in the context of both handcrafted and deep features. The unprecedented performances of the method are proven using five different case studies, ranging from selecting handcrafted green fluorescence protein intensity features in chemotherapy-related breast cancer cell death investigation to addressing problems related to the context of Deep Transfer Learning. Deep-Manager, freely available at https://github.com/BEEuniroma2/Deep-Manager, is suitable for use in many fields of bioimaging and is conceived to be constantly upgraded with novel image acquisition perturbations and modalities.",
