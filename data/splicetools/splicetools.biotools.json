                "abstract": "As a fundamental aspect of normal cell signaling and disease states, there is great interest in determining alternative splicing (AS) changes in physiologic, pathologic, and pharmacologic settings. High throughput RNA sequencing and specialized software to detect AS has greatly enhanced our ability to determine transcriptome-wide splicing changes. Despite the richness of this data, deriving meaning from sometimes thousands of AS events is a substantial bottleneck for most investigators. We present SpliceTools, a suite of data processing modules that arms investigators with the ability to quickly produce summary statistics, mechanistic insights, and functional significance of AS changes through command line or through an online user interface. Utilizing RNA-seq datasets for 186 RNA binding protein knockdowns, nonsense mediated RNA decay inhibition, and pharmacologic splicing inhibition, we illustrate the utility of SpliceTools to distinguish splicing disruption from regulated transcript isoform changes, we show the broad transcriptome footprint of the pharmacologic splicing inhibitor, indisulam, we illustrate the utility in uncovering mechanistic underpinnings of splicing inhibition, we identify predicted neo-epitopes in pharmacologic splicing inhibition, and we show the impact of splicing alterations induced by indisulam on cell cycle progression. Together, SpliceTools puts rapid and easy downstream analysis at the fingertips of any investigator studying AS.",
