                "abstract": "Background: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have shown increasing applicability in chemistry. In this context, visualization techniques can highlight regions of a molecule to reveal their influence over a predicted property. For this purpose, some XAI techniques calculate attribution scores associated with tokens of SMILES strings or with atoms of a molecule. While an association of a score with an atom can be directly visually represented on a molecule diagram, scores computed for SMILES non-atom tokens cannot. For instance, a substring [N+] contains 3 non-atom tokens, i.e., [, + , and], and their attributions, depending on the model, are not necessarily revealing an influence of the nitrogen atom over the predicted property; for that reason, it is not possible to represent the scores on a molecule diagram. Moreover, SMILES’s notation is complex, foregrounding the need for techniques to facilitate the analysis of explanations associated with their tokens. Results: We propose XSMILES, an interactive visualization technique, to explore explainable artificial intelligence attributions scores and support the interpretation of SMILES. Users can input any type of score attributed to atom and non-atom tokens and visualize them on top of a 2D molecule diagram coordinated with a bar chart that represents a SMILES string. We demonstrate how attributions calculated for SMILES strings can be evaluated and better interpreted through interactivity with two use cases. Conclusions: Data scientists can use XSMILES to understand their models’ behavior and compare multiple modeling approaches. The tool provides a set of parameters to adapt the visualization to users’ needs and it can be integrated into different platforms. We believe XSMILES can support data scientists to develop, improve, and communicate their models by making it easier to identify patterns and compare attributions through interactive exploratory visualization.",
