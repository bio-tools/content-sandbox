    "description": "ECJ is a research EC system written in Java. It was designed to be highly flexible, with nearly all classes (and all of their settings) dynamically determined at runtime by a user-provided parameter file. All structures in the system are arranged to be easily modifiable. Even so, the system was designed with an eye toward efficiency.",

                "abstract": "ECJ is now 20 years old. Begun as a genetic programming and evolutionary computation library in Java, it has since established itself as historically one of the most popular EC toolkits worldwide. In 2016 we received a National Science Foundation grant to improve ECJ in many ways with an eye toward making it a useful toolkit not just for EC but for the broader metaheuristics community. This paper is a report on our efforts to this end. We discuss new metaheuristics frameworks and representations added to ECJ and the design challenges that they raise for a general-purpose framework, as well as testing facilities and other support tools. We conclude with our future directions for the library.",
