    "description": "The Open Targets Platform is a comprehensive tool that supports systematic identification and prioritisation of potential therapeutic drug targets.\n\nBy integrating publicly available datasets including data generated by the Open Targets consortium, the Platform builds and scores target-disease associations to assist in drug target identification and prioritisation. It also integrates relevant annotation information about targets, diseases, phenotypes, and drugs, as well as their most relevant relationships.\n\nThe Platform is a freely available resource that is actively maintained with bi-monthly updates. The data can be accessed through an intuitive web user interface, an API, Google BigQuery, and a comprehensive set of datasets available for download in JSON and Parquet formats. The pipeline and infrastructure codebases that support the Platform are open-source and can be used to create a self-hosted private instance of the Platform with custom data.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The Open Targets Platform (https://platform.opentargets.org/) is an open source resource to systematically assist drug target identification and prioritisation using publicly available data. Since our last update, we have reimagined, redesigned, and rebuilt the Platform in order to streamline data integration and harmonisation, expand the ways in which users can explore the data, and improve the user experience. The gene-disease causal evidence has been enhanced and expanded to better capture disease causality across rare, common, and somatic diseases. For target and drug annotations, we have incorporated new features that help assess target safety and tractability, including genetic constraint, PROTACtability assessments, and AlphaFold structure predictions. We have also introduced new machine learning applications for knowledge extraction from the published literature, clinical trial information, and drug labels. The new technologies and frameworks introduced since the last update will ease the introduction of new features and the creation of separate instances of the Platform adapted to user requirements. Our new Community forum, expanded training materials, and outreach programme support our users in a range of use cases.",

The platform is designed to support identification and prioritization of biological targets for follow-up. Each drug target is linked to a disease using integrated genome-wide data from a broad range of data sources. The platform provides either a target-centric workflow to identify diseases that may be associated with a specific target, or a disease-centric workflow to identify targets that may be associated with a specific disease. Users can easily transition between these target- and diseasecentric workflows. The Open Targets Validation Platform is accessible at https://www.targetvalidation.org.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The Open Targets Platform (https://www.targetvalidation.org/) provides users with a queryable knowledgebase and user interface to aid systematic target identification and prioritisation for drug discovery based upon underlying evidence. It is publicly available and the underlying code is open source. Since our last update two years ago, we have had 10 releases to maintain and continuously improve evidence for target-disease relationships from 20 different data sources. In addition, we have integrated new evidence from key datasets, including prioritised targets identified from genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens in 300 cancer models (Project Score), and GWAS/UK BioBank statistical genetic analysis evidence from the Open Targets Genetics Portal. We have evolved our evidence scoring framework to improve target identification. To aid the prioritisation of targets and inform on the potential impact of modulating a given target, we have added evaluation of post-marketing adverse drug reactions and new curated information on target tractability and safety. We have also developed the user interface and backend technologies to improve performance and usability. In this article, we describe the latest enhancements to the Platform, to address the fundamental challenge that developing effective and safe drugs is difficult and expensive.",

The associations are displayed in an intuitive user interface (https://www.targetvalidation.org), and are available through a REST-API (https://api.opentargets.io/v3/platform/docs/swagger-ui) and a bulk download (https://www.targetvalidation.org/downloads/data). In addition to target-disease associations, we also aggregate and display data at the target and disease levels to aid target prioritisation. Since our first publication two years ago, we have made eight releases, added new data sources for target-disease associations, started including causal genetic variants from non genome-wide targeted arrays, added new target and disease annotations, launched new visualisations and improved existing ones and released a new web tool for batch search of up to 200 targets. We have a new URL for the Open Targets Platform REST-API, new REST endpoints and also removed the need for authorisation for API fair use. Here, we present the latest developments of the Open Targets Platform, expanding the evidence and target-disease associations with new and improved data sources, refining data quality, enhancing website usability, and increasing our user base with our training workshops, user support, social media and bioinformatics forum engagement.",
