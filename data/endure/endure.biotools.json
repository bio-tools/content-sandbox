                "abstract": "Recent developments in machine learning have greatly facilitated the design of proteins with improved properties. However, accurately assessing the contributions of an individual or multiple amino acid mutations to overall protein stability to select the most promising mutants remains a challenge. Knowing the specific types of amino acid interactions that improve energetic stability is crucial for finding favorable combinations of mutations and deciding which mutants to test experimentally. In this work, we present an interactive workflow for assessing the energetic contributions of single and multi-mutant designs of proteins. The energy breakdown guided protein design (ENDURE) workflow includes several key algorithms, including per-residue energy analysis and the sum of interaction energies calculations, which are performed using the Rosetta energy function, as well as a residue depth analysis, which enables tracking the energetic contributions of mutations occurring in different spatial layers of the protein structure. ENDURE is available as a web application that integrates easy-to-read summary reports and interactive visualizations of the automated energy calculations and helps users selecting protein mutants for further experimental characterization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool in identifying the mutations in a designed polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-degrading enzyme that add up to an improved thermodynamic stability. We expect that ENDURE can be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working in the field of protein design and optimization.
