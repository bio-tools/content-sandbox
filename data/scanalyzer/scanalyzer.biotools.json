                "abstract": "Â© The Author(s) 2022.Introduction: The application of single-cell RNA sequencing to delineate tissue heterogeneity and complexity has become increasingly popular. Given its tremendous resolution and high-dimensional capacity for in-depth investigation, single-cell RNA sequencing offers an unprecedented research power. Although some popular software packages are available for single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis and visualization, it is still a big challenge for their usage, as they provide only a command-line interface and require significant level of bioinformatics skills. Methods: We have developed scAnalyzeR, which is a single-cell RNA sequencing analysis pipeline with an interactive and user-friendly graphical interface for analyzing and visualizing single-cell RNA sequencing data. It accepts single-cell RNA sequencing data from various technology platforms and different model organisms (human and mouse) and allows flexibility in input file format. It provides functionalities for data preprocessing, quality control, basic summary statistics, dimension reduction, unsupervised clustering, differential gene expression, gene set enrichment analysis, correlation analysis, pseudotime cell trajectory inference, and various visualization plots. It also provides default parameters for easy usage and allows a wide range of flexibility and optimization by accepting user-defined options. It has been developed as a docker image that can be run in any docker-supported environment including Linux, Mac, and Windows, without installing any dependencies. Results: We compared the performance of scAnalyzeR with 2 other graphical tools that are popular for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data. The comparison was based on the comprehensiveness of functionalities, ease of usage and flexibility, and execution time. In general, scAnalyzeR outperformed the other tested counterparts in various aspects, demonstrating its superior overall performance. To illustrate the usefulness of scAnalyzeR in cancer research, we have analyzed the in-house liver cancer single-cell RNA sequencing dataset. Liver cancer tumor cells were revealed to have multiple subpopulations with distinctive gene expression signatures. Conclusion: scAnalyzeR has comprehensive functionalities and demonstrated usability. We anticipate more functionalities to be adopted in the future development.",
