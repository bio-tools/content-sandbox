                "abstract": "Â© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Chromosome conformation capture and its derivatives have provided substantial genetic data for understanding how chromatin self-organizes. These techniques have identified regions of high intrasequence interactions called topologically associated domains (TADs). TADs are structural and functional units that shape chromosomes and influence genomic expression. Many of these domains differ across cell development and can be impacted by diseases. Thus, analysis of the identified domains can provide insight into genome regulation. Hence, there are many approaches to identifying such domains across many cell lines. Despite the availability of multiple tools for TAD detection, TAD callers' speed, flexibility, result inconsistency, and reproducibility remain challenges in this research area. Results: In this work, we developed a computational webserver called TADMaster that provides an analysis suite to directly evaluate the concordance level and robustness of two or more TAD data on any given genome region. The suite provides multiple visual and quantitative metrics to compare the identified domains' number, size, and various comparisons of shared domains, domain boundaries, and domain overlap. Conclusions: TADMaster is an efficient and easy-to-use web application that provides a set of consensus and unique TADs to inform the choice of TADs. It can be accessed at http://tadmaster.io and is also available as a containerized application that can be deployed and run locally on any platform or operating system.",
