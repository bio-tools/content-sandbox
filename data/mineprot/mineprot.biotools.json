    "description": "AI systems represented by AlphaFold are rapidly expanding the data scale of protein structure modelling, hence how to curate these novel high-throughput data has emerged as a challenge. Here we provide our solution, MineProt, a project to help researchers efficiently set up custom protein servers to facilitate data sharing. It enables users to build their own server in simple steps, run almost out-of-the-box scripts to annotate and curate their proteins, visualize, browse and search their data via a user-friendly online interface, and utilize plugins to extend the functionality of server. Its current version can directly transform results of AlphaFold and ColabFold into a fully functional website, while supporting any other data compatible with its standard as well. MineProt is open-sourced at https://github.com/huiwenke/MineProt.",
