                "abstract": "Â© 2022Uncovering gene regulatory mechanisms in individual cells can provide insight into cell heterogeneity and function. Recent accumulated Single-Cell RNA-Seq data have made it possible to analyze gene regulation at single-cell resolution. Understanding cell-type-specific gene regulation can assist in more accurate cell type and state identification. Computational approaches utilizing such relationships are under development. Methods pioneering in integrating gene regulatory mechanism discovery with cell-type classification encounter challenges such as determine gene regulatory relationships and incorporate gene regulatory network structure. To fill this gap, we developed INSISTC, a computational method to incorporate gene regulatory network structure information for single-cell type classification. INSISTC is capable of identifying cell-type-specific gene regulatory mechanisms while performing single-cell type classification. INSISTC demonstrated its accuracy in cell type classification and its potential for providing insight into molecular mechanisms specific to individual cells. In comparison with the alternative methods, INSISTC demonstrated its complementary performance for gene regulation interpretation.",
