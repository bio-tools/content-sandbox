                "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that the dysregulation of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) is relevant with diseases. Identifying snoRNA-disease associations by computational methods is desired for biologists, which can save considerable costs and time compared biological experiments. However, it still faces some challenges as followings: (i) Many snoRNAs are detected in recent years, but only a few snoRNAs have been proved to be associated with diseases; (ii) Computational predictors trained with only a few known snoRNA-disease associations fail to accurately identify the snoRNA-disease associations. In this study, we propose a ranking framework, called iSnoDi-MDRF, to identify potential snoRNA-disease associations based on multiple biological data, which has the following highlights: (i) iSnoDi-MDRF integrates ranking framework, which is not only able to identify potential associations between known snoRNAs and diseases, but also can identify diseases associated with new snoRNAs. (ii) Known gene-disease associations are employed to help train a mature model for predicting snoRNA-disease association. Experimental results illustrate that iSnoDi-MDRF is very suitable for identifying potential snoRNA-disease associations.
