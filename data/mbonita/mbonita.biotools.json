                "abstract": "Multiomics profiling provides a holistic picture of a condition being examined and captures the complexity of signaling events, beginning from the original cause (environmental or genetic), to downstream functional changes at multiple molecular layers. Pathway enrichment analysis has been used with multiomics data sets to characterize signaling mechanisms. However, technical and biological variability between these layered data limit an integrative computational analyses. We present a Boolean network-based method, multiomics Boolean Omics Network Invariant-Time Analysis (mBONITA), to integrate omics data sets that quantify multiple molecular layers. mBONITA utilizes prior knowledge networks to perform topology-based pathway analysis. In addition, mBONITA identifies genes that are consistently modulated across molecular measurements by combining observed fold-changes and variance, with a measure of node (i.e., gene or protein) influence over signaling, and a measure of the strength of evidence for that gene across data sets. We used mBONITA to integrate multiomics data sets from RAMOS B cells treated with the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine A under varying O2 tensions to identify pathways involved in hypoxia-mediated chemotaxis. We compare mBONITAâ€™s performance with 6 other pathway analysis methods designed for multiomics data and show that mBONITA identifies a set of pathways with evidence of modulation across all omics layers. mBONITA is freely available at https://github.com/Thakar-Lab/mBONITA.",
