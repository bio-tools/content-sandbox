                "abstract": "Enhancers play a crucial role in controlling gene transcription and expression. Therefore, bioinformatics puts many emphases on predicting enhancers and their strength. It is vital to create quick and accurate calculating techniques because conventional biomedical tests take too long time and are too expensive. This paper proposed a new predictor called iEnhancer-DCSV built on a modified densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet) and an improved convolutional block attention module (CBAM). Coding was performed using one-hot and nucleotide chemical property (NCP). DenseNet was used to extract advanced features from raw coding. The channel attention and spatial attention modules were used to evaluate the significance of the advanced features and then input into a fully connected neural network to yield the prediction probabilities. Finally, ensemble learning was employed on the final categorization findings via voting. According to the experimental results on the test set, the first layer of enhancer recognition achieved an accuracy of 78.95%, and the Matthews correlation coefficient value was 0.5809. The second layer of enhancer strength prediction achieved an accuracy of 80.70%, and the Matthews correlation coefficient value was 0.6609. The iEnhancer-DCSV method can be found at https://github.com/leirufeng/iEnhancer-DCSV. It is easy to obtain the desired results without using the complex mathematical formulas involved.",
