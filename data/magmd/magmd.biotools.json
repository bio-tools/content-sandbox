                "abstract": "Â© 2022 The AuthorsAn increasing number of studies have reported that microbiome can affect drug response by altering pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of formation of toxic metabolites. With the development of metagenomic sequencing, gut microbial composition as well as the metabolic function are drawing more and more attention for the patient stratification. The established microbiota databases provide useful information about the gut microbe-drug interactions. However, these databases generally lacked the detailed effects on substance and the metabolites, which are helpful in elucidating the mechanisms underlying drug biotransformation and personalized medicine. To address these issues, in this study, we developed Metabolic action of gut Microbiota to Drugs (MagMD), a database and a web-service covering 32, 678 records of interactions between 2,146 gut microbes, 36 enzymes and 219 substrates (mainly drugs). The detailed annotations for each entry, including the taxonomic level of microbes, the molecular form and PubChem ID of drugs from PubChem Compound Database, types of microbial secreted enzymes and the original reference links can also be accessed from the web service. Availability and implementation: MagMD is a publicly available resource, constantly updated. It has an intuitive web interface and can be freely accessed at http://www.unimd.org/magmd.",
