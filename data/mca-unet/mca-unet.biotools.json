                "abstract": "Medical image segmentation is a challenging task due to the high variation in shape, size and position of infections or lesions in medical images. It is necessary to construct multi-scale representations to capture image contents from different scales. However, it is still challenging for U-Net with a simple skip connection to model the global multi-scale context. To overcome it, we proposed a dense skip-connection with cross co-attention in U-Net to solve the semantic gaps for an accurate automatic medical image segmentation. We name our method MCA-UNet, which enjoys two benefits: (1) it has a strong ability to model the multi-scale features, and (2) it jointly explores the spatial and channel attentions. The experimental results on the COVID-19 and IDRiD datasets suggest that our MCA-UNet produces more precise segmentation performance for the consolidation, ground-glass opacity (GGO), microaneurysms (MA) and hard exudates (EX).
