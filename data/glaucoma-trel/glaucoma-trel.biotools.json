                "abstract": "Â© 2022, The Author(s).Objective: Glaucoma is a chronic neurological disease that is associated with high intraocular pressure (IOP), causes gradual damage to retinal ganglion cells, and often culminates in vision loss. Recent research suggests that glaucoma is a complex multifactorial disease in which multiple interlinked genes and pathways play a role during onset and development. Also, differential availability of trace elements seems to play a role in glaucoma pathophysiology, although their mechanism of action is unknown. The aim of this work is to disseminate a web-based repository on interactions between trace elements and protein-coding genes linked to glaucoma pathophysiology. Results: In this study, we present Glaucoma-TrEl, a web database containing information about interactions between trace elements and protein-coding genes that are linked to glaucoma. In the database, we include interactions between 437 unique genes and eight trace elements. Our analysis found a large number of interactions between trace elements and protein-coding genes mutated or linked to the pathophysiology of glaucoma. We associated genes interacting with multiple trace elements to pathways known to play a role in glaucoma. The web-based platform provides an easy-to-use and interactive tool, which serves as an information hub facilitating future research work on trace elements in glaucoma.",
