                "abstract": "Most cell-cell interactions and crosstalks are mediated by ligand-receptor interactions. The advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques has enabled characterizing tissue heterogeneity at single-cell level. In the past few years, several methods have been developed to study ligand-receptor interactions at cell type level using scRNA-seq data. However, there is still no easy way to query the activity of a specific user-defined signaling pathway in a targeted way or to map the interactions of the same subunit with different ligands as part of different receptor complexes. Here, we present DiSiR, a fast and easy-to-use permutation-based software framework to investigate how individual cells are interacting with each other by analyzing signaling pathways of multi-subunit ligand-activated receptors from scRNA-seq data, not only for available curated databases of ligand-receptor interactions, but also for interactions that are not listed in these databases. We show that, when utilized to infer ligand-receptor interactions from both simulated and real datasets, DiSiR outperforms other well-known permutation-based methods, e.g. CellPhoneDB and ICELLNET. Finally, to demonstrate DiSiR's utility in exploring data and generating biologically relevant hypotheses, we apply it to COVID lung and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium scRNA-seq datasets and highlight potential differences between inflammatory pathways at cell type level for control versus disease samples.",
