The related research is blocked by lacking of comprehensive resources for researchers to discovery and analysis signatures, then further exploring the mechanisms. Here, we first offered a benchmarking dataset of experimentally supported signatures of cancer immunotherapy by manually curated from published literature works and provided an overview. We then developed CiTSA (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/CiTSA/) which stores 878 entries of experimentally supported associations between 412 signatures such as genes, cells, and immunotherapy across 30 cancer types. CiTSA also provides flexible online tools to identify and visualize molecular/cell feature and interaction, to perform function, correlation, and survival analysis, and to execute cell clustering, cluster activity, and cellâ€“cell communication analysis based on single cell and bulk datasets of cancer immunotherapy. In summary, we provided an overview of experimentally supported cancer immunotherapy signatures and developed CiTSA which is a comprehensive and high-quality resource and is helpful for understanding the mechanism of cancer immunity and immunotherapy, developing novel therapeutic targets and promoting precision immunotherapy for cancer.",
