However, the clinical benefit is restricted by the high incidence of organ rejection. Therefore, there exists a wealth of literature regarding the mechanism of renal transplant rejection, including a large library of expression data. In recent years, research has shown the immune microenvironment to play an important role in renal transplant rejection. Nephrology web analysis tools currently exist to address chronic nephropathy, renal tumors and children’s kidneys, but no such tool exists that analyses the impact of immune microenvironment in renal transplantation rejection. Methods: To fill this gap, we have developed a web page analysis tool called Comprehensive Analysis of Renal Allograft Rerejction in Immune Microenvironment (CARARIME). Results: CARARIME analyzes the gene expression and immune microenvironment of published renal transplant rejection cohorts, including differential analysis (gene expression and immune cells), prognosis analysis (logistics regression, Univariable Cox Regression and Kaplan Meier), correlation analysis, enrichment analysis (GSEA and ssGSEA), and ROC analysis. Conclusions: Using this tool, researchers can easily analyze the immune microenvironment in the context of renal transplant rejection by clicking on the available options, helping to further the development of approaches to renal transplant rejection in the immune microenvironment field. CARARIME can be found in http://www.cararime.com.",
