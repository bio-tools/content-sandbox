                "abstract": "Â© 2022 The Authors. Insect Science published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd on behalf of Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.Insect olfactory receptors (iORs) with atypical 7-transmembrane domains, unlike Chordata olfactory receptors, are not in the GPCR protein family. iORs selectively bind to volatile ligands in the environment and affect essential insect behaviors. In this study, we constructed a new platform (iORbase, https://www.iorbase.com) for the structural and functional analysis of iORs based on a combined algorithm for gene annotation and protein structure prediction. Moreover, it provides the option to calculate the binding affinities and binding residues between iORs and pheromone molecules by virtual screening of docking. Furthermore, iORbase supports the automatic structural and functional prediction of user-submitted iORs or pheromones. iORbase contains the well-analyzed results of approximately 6 000 iORs and their 3D protein structures identified from 59 insect species and 2 077 insect pheromones from the literature, as well as approximately 12 million pairs of simulated interactions between functional iORs and pheromones. We also built 4 online modules, iORPDB, iInteraction, iModelTM, and iOdorTool to easily retrieve and visualize the 3D structures and interactions. iORbase can help greatly improve the experimental efficiency and success rate, identify new insecticide targets, or develop electronic nose technology. This study will shed light on the olfactory recognition mechanism and evolutionary characteristics from the perspectives of omics and macroevolution.",
