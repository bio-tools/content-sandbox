For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.MOTIVATION: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a fundamental problem in bioinformatics. The quality of alignment will affect downstream analysis. MAFFT has adopted the Fast Fourier Transform method for searching the homologous segments and using them as anchors to divide the sequences, then making alignment only on segments, which can save time and memory without overly reducing the sequence alignment quality. MAFFT becomes slow when the dataset is large. RESULTS: We made a software, WMSA, which uses the divide-and-conquer method to split the sequences into clusters, aligns those clusters into profiles with the center star strategy and then makes a progressive profile-profile alignment. The alignment is conducted by the compiled algorithms of MAFFT, K-Band with multithread parallelism. Our method can balance time, space and quality and performs better than MAFFT in test experiments on highly conserved datasets.
