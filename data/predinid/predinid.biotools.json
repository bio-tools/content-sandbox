                "abstract": "Inframe insertion&#x002F;deletion (indel) variants may alter protein sequence and function, which are closely related to an extensive variety of diseases. Although recent researches have paid attention to the associations between inframe indels and diseases, modeling indels in silico and interpreting their pathogenicity remain challenging, mainly due to the lack of experimental information and computational methodologies. In this paper, we propose a novel computational method named PredinID (Predictor for inframe InDels) via graph convolutional network (GCN). PredinID leverages k-nearest neighbor algorithm to construct the feature graph for aggregating more informative representation, regarding the pathogenic inframe indel prediction as a node classification task. An edge-based sampling strategy is designed for extracting information from both the potential connections of feature space and the topological structure of subgraphs. Evaluated by 5-fold cross-validations, the PredinID method achieves satisfactory performance and is superior to four classic machine learning algorithms and two GCN methods. Comprehensive experiments show that PredinID has superior performances when compared with the state-of-the-art methods on the independent test set. Moreover, we also implement a web server at http:&#x002F;&#x002F;predinid.bio.aielab.cc&#x002F;, to facilitate the use of the model.",
