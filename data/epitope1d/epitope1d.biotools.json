                "abstract": "The ability to identify B-cell epitopes is an essential step in vaccine design, immunodiagnostic tests and antibody production. Several computational approaches have been proposed to identify, from an antigen protein or peptide sequence, which residues are more likely to be part of an epitope, but have limited performance on relatively homogeneous data sets and lack interpretability, limiting biological insights that could otherwise be obtained. To address these limitations, we have developed epitope1D, an explainable machine learning method capable of accurately identifying linear B-cell epitopes, leveraging two new descriptors: a graph-based signature representation of protein sequences, based on our well-established Cutoff Scanning Matrix algorithm and Organism Ontology information. Our model achieved Areas Under the ROC curve of up to 0.935 on cross-validation and blind tests, demonstrating robust performance. A comprehensive comparison to alternative methods using distinct benchmark data sets was also employed, with our model outperforming state-of-the-art tools. epitope1D represents not only a significant advance in predictive performance, but also allows biologically meaningful features to be combined and used for model interpretation. epitope1D has been made available as a user-friendly web server interface and application programming interface at https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/epitope1d/.",
