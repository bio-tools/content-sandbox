T6SS increasingly gained attention due to its important influence on pathogenesis, microbial competition, etc. T6SS-associated research is explosively expanding on numerous grounds that call for an efficient resource. The SecReT6 version 3 provides comprehensive information on T6SS and the interactions between T6SS and T6SS-related proteins such as T6SS regulators and T6SS effectors. To assist T6SS researches like microbial competition and regulatory mechanisms, SecReT6 v3 developed online tools for detection and analysis of T6SS and T6SS-related proteins and estimation of T6SS-dependent killing risk. We have identified a novel T6SS regulator and T6SS-dependent killing capacity in Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates with the aid of SecReT6 v3. 17,212 T6SSs and plentiful T6SS-related proteins in 26,573 bacterial complete genomes were also detected, analyzed and incorporated into the database. The database is freely available at https://bioinfo-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/SecReT6/.",
