                "abstract": "The utilization of medicinal plants for their therapeutic properties has long been a key component of Indian culture. Unique medicinal characteristics can be found in the phytochemicals that are extracted from these plants. Globally, tuberculosis (TB) burden and management are challenged due to the emergence of new resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). This highlights the importance of new drug molecules from diverse sources as well as their innovative management options. In this context, the present study formulated an Anti Mtb medicinal plant database (AMMPDB Ver. 1.1), a manually curated database of native Indian medicinal plants that reported anti-tubercular (anti-TB) activities and their potential therapeutic phytochemicals. This is the first-ever freely accessible digital repository. The current version of the database provides users, with information regarding 118 native Indian anti-tubercular medicinal plants and their 3374 phytochemicals. The database provides the following information: Taxonomical ID, botanical description, vernacular names, conservation status, geographical distribution maps, IC-50 value, phytochemical details which include - name, Compound ID, Synonyms, location in plant part, 2D, 3D structures (as per the availability), and their medicinal uses reported in the literature. The tools section of the database is equipped with sequentially catalogued and hyperlinked open-access tools utilized for computational drug designing. A case study has been incorporated under the contributors section to validate the tools section and the phytochemicals of the database. AMMPDB Ver 1.1 will be serviceable to research in computational drug designing and discovery with effectiveness and ease. Database URL: https://www.ammpdb.com/",
