                "abstract": "© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Promoters, non-coding DNA sequences located at upstream regions of the transcription start site of genes/gene clusters, are essential regulatory elements for the initiation and regulation of transcriptional processes. Furthermore, identifying promoters in DNA sequences and genomes significantly contributes to discovering entire structures of genes of interest. Therefore, exploration of promoter regions is one of the most imperative topics in molecular genetics and biology. Besides experimental techniques, computational methods have been developed to predict promoters. In this study, we propose iPromoter-Seqvec – an efficient computational model to predict TATA and non-TATA promoters in human and mouse genomes using bidirectional long short-term memory neural networks in combination with sequence-embedded features extracted from input sequences. The promoter and non-promoter sequences were retrieved from the Eukaryotic Promoter database and then were refined to create four benchmark datasets. Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR) were used as two key metrics to evaluate model performance. Results on independent test sets showed that iPromoter-Seqvec outperformed other state-of-the-art methods with AUCROC values ranging from 0.85 to 0.99 and AUCPR values ranging from 0.86 to 0.99. Models predicting TATA promoters in both species had slightly higher predictive power compared to those predicting non-TATA promoters. With a novel idea of constructing artificial non-promoter sequences based on promoter sequences, our models were able to learn highly specific characteristics discriminating promoters from non-promoters to improve predictive efficiency. Conclusions: iPromoter-Seqvec is a stable and robust model for predicting both TATA and non-TATA promoters in human and mouse genomes. Our proposed method was also deployed as an online web server with a user-friendly interface to support research communities.
