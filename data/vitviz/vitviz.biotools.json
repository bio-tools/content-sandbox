                "abstract": "Copyright © 2022 Savoi, Santiago, Orduña and Matus.Transcriptomics and metabolomics are methodologies being increasingly chosen to perform molecular studies in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.), focusing either on plant and fruit development or on interaction with abiotic or biotic factors. Currently, the integration of these approaches has become of utmost relevance when studying key plant physiological and metabolic processes. The results from these analyses can undoubtedly be incorporated in breeding programs whereby genes associated with better fruit quality (e.g., those enhancing the accumulation of health-promoting compounds) or with stress resistance (e.g., those regulating beneficial responses to environmental transition) can be used as selection markers in crop improvement programs. Despite the vast amount of data being generated, integrative transcriptome/metabolome meta-analyses (i.e., the joint analysis of several studies) have not yet been fully accomplished in this species, mainly due to particular specificities of metabolomic studies, such as differences in data acquisition (i.e., different compounds being investigated), unappropriated and unstandardized metadata, or simply no deposition of data in public repositories. These meta-analyses require a high computational capacity for data mining a priori, but they also need appropriate tools to explore and visualize the integrated results. This perspective article explores the universe of omics studies conducted in V. vinifera, focusing on fruit-transcriptome and metabolome analyses as leading approaches to understand berry physiology, secondary metabolism, and quality. Moreover, we show how omics data can be integrated in a simple format and offered to the research community as a web resource, giving the chance to inspect potential gene-to-gene and gene-to-metabolite relationships that can later be tested in hypothesis-driven research. In the frame of the activities promoted by the COST Action CA17111 INTEGRAPE, we present the first grapevine transcriptomic and metabolomic integrated database (TransMetaDb) developed within the Vitis Visualization (VitViz) platform (https://tomsbiolab.com/vitviz). This tool also enables the user to conduct and explore meta-analyses utilizing different experiments, therefore hopefully motivating the community to generate Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (F.A.I.R.) data to be included in the future.",
