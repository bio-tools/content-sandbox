    "description": "The GDD, a GPCR Decoy Database, with its accompanying GPCR Ligand Library (GLL) have been compiled to help in GPCR docking. The main characteristics of GLL and GDD are:\n\nSets of ligands and decoys for 147 GPCR targets.\nFor each ligand, 39 decoys were drawn from ZINC ensuring physical similarity of six properties (molecular weight, formal charge, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, rotatable bonds and logP), but structural dissimilarity.",

Decoys were chosen ensuring a ligand-decoy similarity of six physical properties, while enforcing ligand-decoy chemical dissimilarity. The performance in docking of the GDD was evaluated on 19 GPCRs, showing a marked decrease in enrichment compared to biasuncorrected decoy sets.
