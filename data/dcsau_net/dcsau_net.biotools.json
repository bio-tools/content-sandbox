                "abstract": "Deep learning architecture with convolutional neural network achieves outstanding success in the field of computer vision. Where U-Net has made a great breakthrough in biomedical image segmentation and has been widely applied in a wide range of practical scenarios. However, the equal design of every downsampling layer in the encoder part and simply stacked convolutions do not allow U-Net to extract sufficient information of features from different depths. The increasing complexity of medical images brings new challenges to the existing methods. In this paper, we propose a deeper and more compact split-attention u-shape network, which efficiently utilises low-level and high-level semantic information based on two frameworks: primary feature conservation and compact split-attention block. We evaluate the proposed model on CVC-ClinicDB, 2018 Data Science Bowl, ISIC-2018, SegPC-2021 and BraTS-2021 datasets. As a result, our proposed model displays better performance than other state-of-the-art methods in terms of the mean intersection over union and dice coefficient. More significantly, the proposed model demonstrates excellent segmentation performance on challenging images.
