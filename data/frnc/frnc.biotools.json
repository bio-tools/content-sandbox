                "abstract": "The RNA binding protein (RBP) and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) interacting networks are increasingly recognized as the main mechanism in gene regulation, and are tightly associated with cellular malfunction and disease. Here, we present fRNC, a systems biology tool to uncover the dynamic spectrum of RBP-ncRNA circuits (RNC) by integrating transcriptomics, interactomics and proteomics data. fRNC constructs the RBP-ncRNA network derived from CLIP-seq or PARE experiments. Given scoring on nodes and edges according to differential analysis of expression data, it finds an RNC containing global maximum significant RBPs and ncRNAs. Alternatively, it can also capture the locally maximum scoring RNC according to user-defined starting nodes with the greedy search. When compared with existing tools, fRNC can detect more accurate and robust sub-network with scalability. As shown in the cases of esophageal carcinoma, breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease, fRNC enables users to analyze the collective behaviors between RBP and the interacting ncRNAs, and reveal novel insights into the disease-associated processes. The fRNC R package is available at https://github.com/BioinformaticsSTU/fRNC.",
