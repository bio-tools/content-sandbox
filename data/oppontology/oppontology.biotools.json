                "abstract": "Â© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Biologists often use systems of ontologies to classify gene lists obtained by high-throughput gene or protein-sequencing instruments, and then enrichment scores were used to rank the ontology system. Therefore, the important molecular functional categories related to the phenotype can be conveniently viewed in the ontology system. Since the birth of GO (Gene Ontology) organization, various types of ontology software have been developed to calculate enrichment scores for the target gene list in the GO system. Herein, we provide an enrichment calculation application oppOntology (Omics Pilot Platform for Ontology) developed by MATLAB. oppOntology supports simultaneous calculation of multiple samples with manifold enrichment scores (GeneCount, GeneRatio, EnrichFactor, HypergeometricTest, and FisherExactTest). oppOntology can not only calculate enrichment scores for generic functional databases, such as GO, KEGG, HPO, and MsigDB, but also for self-defined functional category databases and customized GO Slim. Moreover, oppOntology supports online mapping of KEGG pathway diagrams in a batch way. The GUI (Graphical User Interface) of oppOntology is developed on the architecture of AppDesigner in MATLAB, and all input and output files are Microsoft Excel. oppOntology is an independent, easy-to-use enrichment calculation software, that can be available at https://github.com/HangZhouSheep/oppOntology.",
