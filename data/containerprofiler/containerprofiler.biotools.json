    "description": "The Container Profiler tool supports profiling resource utilization including CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics of containerized tasks. Resource utilization metrics are obtained across three levels: virtual machine (VM)/host, container, and process. Our implementation leverages facilities provided by the Linux operating system that is integral with Docker containers. Development and testing of the Container Profiler described in this paper was completed using Debian-based Ubuntu Linux.",
