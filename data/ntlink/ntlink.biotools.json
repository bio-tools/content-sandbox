                "abstract": "With the increasing affordability and accessibility of genome sequencing data, de novo genome assembly is an important first step to a wide variety of downstream studies and analyses. Therefore, bioinformatics tools that enable the generation of high-quality genome assemblies in a computationally efficient manner are essential. Recent developments in long-read sequencing technologies have greatly benefited genome assembly work, including scaffolding, by providing long-range evidence that can aid in resolving the challenging repetitive regions of complex genomes. ntLink is a flexible and resource-efficient genome scaffolding tool that utilizes long-read sequencing data to improve upon draft genome assemblies built from any sequencing technologies, including the same long reads. Instead of using read alignments to identify candidate joins, ntLink utilizes minimizer-based mappings to infer how input sequences should be ordered and oriented into scaffolds. Recent improvements to ntLink have added important features such as overlap detection, gap-filling, and in-code scaffolding iterations. Here, we present three basic protocols demonstrating how to use each of these new features to yield highly contiguous genome assemblies, while still maintaining ntLink's proven computational efficiency. Further, as we illustrate in the alternate protocols, the lightweight minimizer-based mappings that enable ntLink scaffolding can also be utilized for other downstream applications, such as misassembly detection. With its modularity and multiple modes of execution, ntLink has broad benefit to the genomics community, from genome scaffolding and beyond. ntLink is an open-source project and is freely available from https://github.com/bcgsc/ntLink.
