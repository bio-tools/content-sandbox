                "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of non-coding RNA that, unlike linear RNAs, form a covalently closed loop without the 5′ and 3′ ends. Growing evidence shows that circular RNAs play important roles in life processes and have great potential implications in clinical and research fields. The accurate modeling of circRNAs structure and stability has far-reaching impact on our understanding of their functions and our ability to develop RNA-based therapeutics. The cRNAsp12 server offers a user-friendly web interface to predict circular RNA secondary structures and folding stabilities from the sequence. Through the helix-based landscape partitioning strategy, the server generates distinct ensembles of structures and predicts the minimal free energy structures for each ensemble with the recursive partition function calculation and backtracking algorithms. For structure predictions in the limited structural ensemble, the server also provides users with the option to set the structural constraints of forcing the base pairs and/or forcing the unpaired bases, such that only structures that meet the criteria are enumerated recursively.",
