                "abstract": "Â© 2022 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shifted the focus of research worldwide, and more than 10 000 new articles per month have concentrated on COVID-19-related topics. Considering this rapidly growing literature, the efficient and precise extraction of the main topics of COVID-19-relevant articles is of great importance. The manual curation of this information for biomedical literature is labor-intensive and time-consuming, and as such the procedure is insufficient and difficult to maintain. In response to these complications, the BioCreative VII community has proposed a challenging task, LitCovid Track, calling for a global effort to automatically extract semantic topics for COVID-19 literature. This article describes our work on the BioCreative VII LitCovid Track. We proposed the LitCovid Ensemble Learning (LCEL) method for the tasks and integrated multiple biomedical pretrained models to address the COVID-19 multi-label classification problem. Specifically, seven different transformer-based pretrained models were ensembled for the initialization and fine-tuning processes independently. To enhance the representation abilities of the deep neural models, diverse additional biomedical knowledge was utilized to facilitate the fruitfulness of the semantic expressions. Simple yet effective data augmentation was also leveraged to address the learning deficiency during the training phase. In addition, given the imbalanced label distribution of the challenging task, a novel asymmetric loss function was applied to the LCEL model, which explicitly adjusted the negative-positive importance by assigning different exponential decay factors and helped the model focus on the positive samples. After the training phase, an ensemble bagging strategy was adopted to merge the outputs from each model for final predictions. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, as LCEL obtains the state-of-the-art performance on the LitCovid dataset. Database URL: https://github.com/JHnlp/LCEL",
